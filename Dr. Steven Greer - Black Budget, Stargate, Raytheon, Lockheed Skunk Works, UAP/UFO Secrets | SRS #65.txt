ladies and gentlemen my next guest needs no introduction he's been on the show before and he has one of the top episodes that we have ever produced here at SRS I'm talking about Dr Stephen Greer he's back this time we're talking about Zero Point Energy and we're talking about technologies that have been hidden from us and the US government by companies such as Lockheed Martin Skunk Works Raytheon Boeing Northrop Grumman and if you think this is a little out there think again because the U.S Senate and the U.S Congress are both digging into this subject matter to get to the bottom of it next week we have three of the five whistleblowers that Dr Greer brought in front of Congress to testify about these technologies that they have had first-hand account seeing they're going to be right here on SRS to give those exact same testimonies ladies and gentlemen if you like the show if you like the information we're putting out please go to Spotify go to Apple podcast leave us a review and I see a lot of you have been out there making content ripping our content off and putting it out on the internet I love it looks amazing we made it super easy for you we put a ton of raw reels links in the description take them make content produce badass stuff if we like it we'll share it monetize it make money off of it all we ask is that you please just tag our show on it that's all we ask anyways love you all this is an awesome episode it has a ton of information in it in the next two weeks is all this subject love you all enjoy the show cheers Dr Greer welcome back to the Sean Ryan Show I'm glad to be here it's always good to see you we've been seeing a lot of each other so I just got back from your whistleblower conference and the premiere of your new documentary and the national Press Club event uh a ton of good information came out of that stuff that nobody's ever heard uh extremely well put together event by the way oh thank you um our volunteers was it really 100 volunteers incredible event uh from start to finish me and and uh my friend Carter who who was the one to connect us uh we just had a fantastic time and and learned so much and so we got a lot to talk about today um diving into some of the Whistleblower stuff we're actually getting a handful of the whistleblowers that that uh I think they came out of this show with your first interview is that correct some of them had been had contacted me and been involved before some since and of course once that law got passed uh allowing a pathway for them to testify about what they knew uh notwithstanding their non-disclosure agreements that sort of opened up a whole uh new tranche of people willing to come forward and that process I I think we're having a couple of new uh whistleblowers every week now oh that's amazing per week yeah well we're going to dive into all of that and um and uh thank you for connecting me with them by the way so let me give you a proper introduction here even though you don't need one but Dr Steven Greer you just came out with a new documentary The Lost Century which is number one on iTunes number one on Amazon number one on anything else Google play all the sites yeah everything number one documentary released retired emergency doctor founder of the disclosure project documentarian author and leading Authority on UFO UAP intelligence you've briefed multiple presidents you've briefed the agency you've briefed Congress I believe uh recently you presented evidence of the illegal black budget projects related to UFO UAP operations by the U.S government and you have 33 years experience working in the UFO UAP Arena right am I missing anything yeah that's good enough dumb we got a lot to cover like I said we got to cover we need to cover the disclosure project we need to cover the Lost Century documentary a little bit of The Whistleblower the little bit of The Whistleblower stuff um your documentary all about Zero Point Energy fascinating stuff what I'd like to do is I'm not 100 spun up on some of the things that you were talking about talking that I think a lot of the the rest of the audience was pretty spun up about and I don't think my audience is a hundred percent spun up on all of these topics either right so I just want to go through um some basic stuff to help me and the audience understand what we're about to talk about a little bit more when it comes to the black budgets and stuff like that so a lot of these companies that you know are part of the military industrial complex if you will I've had a lot of experience with Lockheed with Raytheon with these types of companies when it comes to field operations and and and and and kind of the stuff that I was doing in my Arena as a special operator I don't know about what they're doing and how they play in with this black budget stuff and so I'd like to go through a couple of the companies and just um have you just educate me in the audience about it let's let's start with Lockheed Skunk Works well of course the Skunk Works you know dates back to the 50s and 60s Kelly Johnson uh who's by the way UFO encounter report we have is given to us by Lieutenant Colonel Heckert uh who knew him who was our U2 spy plane witness who encountered these objects uh as a U2 pilot but and then of course Ben Rich Ben Rich was the head of the Lockheed Skunk Works and acknowledged towards the end of his period there um that they had technologies that could quote take T ET home he also stated there were no private conversations anywhere on the earth true no matter what your encryption is and also he said that anything you imagine we can we've already done at the skunk works now there's the Skunk Works that would deal with a conventional jet rocket you know Ram Jet type classified aircraft right but then there's another division that is the Deep black I want to make a distinction between the black budget and highly classified legally overseen projects here I'm talking about you know there's a guy I'm working with now who literally oversees the black budget of the United States he was never read in on the UFO or UAP issue and when he tried to find out he went out to The lockheed's Concourse he was told showing a bunch of these conventional propulsion systems he was not shown the ones that are the man-made UFOs that are the electrogravidics the things that float boom 100 000 miles per hour so I think that that's one of the problems is that there's almost two parallel systems and there's very little points of intersection between the two what I call the constitutional government United States I just called it USG the US government legal and then there's the illegal secret government projects okay the isg so there are compartmented operations at the Lockheed Skunk Works dealing very specifically with this area of technology which has nothing to do with rockets Jets conventional aerodynamics it has to deal with electrographytics which is the ability to create a very high voltage system that causes a electromagnetic field propulsion so there's almost like an electromagnetic field bubble around an object it can levitate lift and it can go you know Mach 300 and never have a sonic boom and no heat on the on the outer section of it these are very Advanced Technologies now those began to be studied back long before I was born and I turned 68 this week so you can imagine how long we've had these these things we actually mastered gravity control in October 1954 one of the members of my team for many years was in the vault okay he was this top scientist at the Naval Research Labs it's a very large Department of Defense lab in DC there um I've been in there and he saw the documentation for this so uh and I think what the public and this is true of the Senators and the congressmen and the White House they are not read in to these other projects they simply aren't you know I had a friend of Trump's tell me over this past weekend uh that that he said we did they just don't tell us much or anything very little so I think that these sort of operations as Eisenhower warned you know have just gotten out of constitutional legal oversight so I call those the illegal secret government projects but those are in The lockheed's Concourse so there's facilities out in the desert if you go out to the Mojave Desert there's an uh a facility and an underground opening so they're really sensitive facilities are all in uh underground Skiffs or dumb steep underground military base facilities and that whole area of California is like a beehive connected underneath with tunnels okay I know where they are I know people who've worked in them now remember those are are those all Lockheed no because those are actually built by Bechtel Corporation or hit construction there are a few contractors who build these underground connectors and for years they used a nuclear-powered tunneling device that would go through bedrock and just classify it so you'd have a connecting tunnel between say Edwards Air Force Base and Nellis range and you never have to go above the surface so I'm very familiar with these and where they're located and I've debriefed a number of guys who've been on them so it's all part of a let's call it a oh a coalition of operations that are corporate contractor and governmental but governmental as in off the reservation of legal oversight and constitutional requirements this is why the Senate and the house are moving quickly to get this under control because about a year and a half ago we were providing enough information that they now realize that this is real that the uaps UFOs are real and they're beginning to realize that a bunch of them are ours but they're being used in deceptive indications and warnings meaning false flag operations so this of course is the the topic that I brought up to the head of the defense intelligence agency the general Patrick Hughes way back in the late 90s I said look you know you guys are being completely zoomed and uh deceived by some of these objects you think might be extraterrestrial but they're ours so Lockheed has some of those Lockheed let's talk about Raytheon has a very uh a certain type of them usually they're trapezoidal or triangular uh my uncle worked for his whole career at Northrop Grumman they have ones that are uh large triangular and uh other shapes but so many of these objects that people think they see a UFO well it's a UFO to them because they don't know how to identify it so one of the things we were doing is juxtaposing an Interstellar vehicle extraterrestrial vehicle with a man-made one and what are the characteristics and differences because operationally and tactically the Pentagon in the White House and Congress need to know this otherwise they're sitting ducks to be deceived by all manner of nonsense who who are the other players so we got Lockheed Skunk Works we got Raytheon we got Northrop Grumman is Boeing involved in this yes there's a division of Boeing that absolutely is involved General Motors has traditionally and Ford and General Electric for sure and egng egng is a major player in this space uh as well as uh Raytheon and TRW um Booz Allen Hamilton has an aspect that deals with this uh problem so are these and then there was the construction company who's building these underground facilities of the Bechtel Corporation and uh hit construction so are these companies competing with each other they do get into competing bids it's a very interesting story one of my whistleblowers who's still too afraid to come forward that I've dealt with for about seven years was 10 years in the Pentagon and worked in a very classified operation deep underneath the Pentagon uh and he was read in across 18 of these uh unacknowledged saps unacknowledged special access projects dealing with this issue and one of the things that happened there there was a three-star General that was brought into uh near the Fort Sill Oklahoma at Walton and there was a skiff an underground facility where we had downed an extraterrestrial vehicle and this General brought an unauthorized person who was his girlfriend who is a Booz Allen Hamilton executive so that she could see what they were studying so her group would get a leg up on the competing contract to study how those objects cloak or disappear and reappear and uh you know he was actually a CID a criminal investigative division after having been a Mainline military and uh I know the general's name we have all this it's been handed over to the investigators for the U.S government but uh he ended up being demoted a star but he was never prosecuted because the Department of Justice was blocked from being able to gain access to what it was that he did because the projects don't exist I mean this is very gets into a very complicated legal and secops uh you know that hold the security around these these operations but because of the extreme level of secrecy the big problem with the public and the media is they think your president your chair of this senate committee and what have you and that there's this vast conspiracy of these kind of people lying to the American public it's the opposite they're actually victims most of them now there are a few Devils I'll be quite blonde I'm not going to name them there are a few devils in the government we know who they are who are sort of embedded operatives to basically Gaslight and deceive members of Congress or people in the white house or what have you um and because they have sort of an all-access pass they can put themselves in positions of authority but their Authority is based on deceiving the Constitutional leadership of the US government I know I am not the only one out there that struggles with sleep I had a major problem sleeping in fact I didn't sleep much at all I wake up in the middle of the night with a sore back a sore neck sweating because I for some reason I sleep hot and then on top of that when you do wake up in the morning because you always get like that last 45 minutes before you know you gotta wake up right and you're it's like the race against the clock to try to get a little bit of sleep then you get to sleep then you gotta spend at least I did my first 45 minutes of the day stretching wandering around the house and all kinds of weird positions just to try to loosen my back up so I can put my shoes on to go to work well then I started going to mattress stores and and you know you guys get it you go to the mattress store and you get like 20 different sales pitches on why you need to buy the six thousand dollar mattress well I had a friend tell me about this company Helix mattresses so I went to the website they got 20 something mattresses to choose from they're all memory foam they have cooling technology that keeps your body cool at night that way you're not waking up sweating like I am and the cool thing is they actually have a test don't worry you're not going to fail it but uh they it's just a questionnaire and they ask you a little bit about your sleep routine what positions you're sleeping in and then they make a recommendation on what they think the best mattress is for you on top of that they have a hundred day test period where you can sleep on the mattresses if you don't like them you can return them exchange them whatever you want to do I'm telling you Helix was a game changer for me now I don't have to wake up and wander around the house do all my stretching it just look I don't even know what it does it just works don't just take my word for it guys GQ and Wired Magazine have named Helix their number one mattress like I said just go online go to Helix sleep.com slash SRS take the quiz it only takes you two minutes Helix is offering 20 off all mattress orders and two free pillows for my listeners again that's Helix sleep.com slash SRS this is their best offer yet and it's not gonna last long go with Helix better sleep starts right now I want to tell you a little bit about my morning routine so it used to be I'd wake up and it was pills Galore I have my multivitamin have my probiotic have my greens replacement had a bunch of other stuff that my multivitamin didn't cover and then I found out about these guys ag1 this is one of their travel packs ag-1 has 75 vitamins and minerals packed in here and they're all Whole Food sourced ingredients the good stuff right so basically dump this travel pack or this other stuff right here the home pack I guess you would call you just take a scoop dump it into some water guys it helps you with gut health helps you with energy it's a total greens replacement there's tons of good stuff in here I recommend taking it every morning and it actually tastes pretty good too if you want to take ownership in your health try ag1 and get a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free ag1 travel packs with your first purchase go to drink ag1.com SRS that's drink ag1.com SRS check it out I'd like to get into that as well back to back to the military-industrial complex companies Raytheon Lockheed Martin skunk work all these how many people do you estimate are on these programs Within These different companies well there are thousands there are thousands at each company not at each company per well in the bigger ones very likely now remember you can have because of top secret special compartmented information protocols you're going to have a guy at this desk in a cube it'll work on something he'll have no idea what this one's working on so you have basically an Enterprise of people that are all working on one project not realizing what that project is correct they wouldn't know now at the more Senior Management and coordination they would obviously but the it's called the pieces out there you know they would have one piece of it but those can be very valuable uh sources of intelligence that I've been meeting with for decades because they may know just one area they may have this one sliver of information I feel like my job has been to do the whole comprehensive intelligence assessment from thousands of pieces from credible people inside these corporations and in government programs and put them together into uh it's like a scattered puzzle with a thousand pieces so you gotta eventually put it together into the picture and so sort of one of my tasks has been is to make that picture come together based on specific evidence whistleblower testimony documents everything which has really been my whole uh project I mean since 92 93 when I briefed the CI director in 93 we had a comprehensive comprehensive assessment of the situation and that's evolved in 30 years obviously because we keep getting more granular detail and specific intelligence and this is what we've been handing over to the US government since they passed the law a couple years ago ordering the Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon the report on this now the problem is the people who are put in charge of that to be quite blunt who couldn't find their ass in a well-lighted room with both hands and sorry it was my old southern expression but they absolutely had no idea you know about the issue and you saw last spring there was a couple of those guys Dr Sean kirpatrick and an Oni guy there before Congress members of Congress who looked at our disclosure project content prior about the Maelstrom Air Force Base Minot North Dakota case where there was a InterContinental intercontinental ballistic missiles taken offline uh I think it was 18 of them something like that and they asked Dr Kirkpatrick and uh the other gentleman from uh Naval intelligence and they go well we've never heard of that well anyone who would have read the disclosure book that came out in 2001 we have the documents we have a government official documents we have the NORAD documents we have the two witnesses one who was in NORAD and one who was in The Silo all on the record right wow firsthand so now we have a hundred of those that we've already brought out go to my YouTube channel you'll see 70 of them up there yeah or 80. the problem is is that when you're first trying to find out about this the amount of information like we're sitting on eight nine ten terabytes of data in my archive that we're trying to organize we call it the disclosure project intelligence archive a dpia and that's what we're putting and organizing and handing off as soon as we get it to any state and new information I hand off another hard drive to these top secret guys who are trying to find out but uh we need to pick up the pace obviously because there's a clock we'll talk about this there's a clock now been set on this well we will get into all that um another when you're talking about these disinformation agents these knocks I have somebody that comes to mind and uh we're talking about them at lunch Lou Elizondo is he one of them no of course I mean you know as soon as he emerged on the stage I had a very senior guy CIA who's worked this issue since 1979 uh contact me about that problem but remember the only way that you can control at this point all this coming out because of what we have and what we're pushing forward through media uh is to control the narrative the spin so the people coming forward who get an all-access pass on to say 60 Minutes or something like that or people cleared by the same illegal corrupt organization because they'll tell the public yes the uaps are real but we don't know what they are well this is an absolute lie we absolutely know what they are some of them are ours man-made and are confused quite frequently with the others which are of extraterrestrial origin or etvs extraterrestrial vehicles and those uh operatives are taught very well to take an issue grab it capture it and then spin it in the direction that they want now the direction they want is endless ambiguity gee we don't know what they are we don't know what they are it's nonsense we've proven what they are well you know I have 755 whistleblowers you have 755 whistleblowers I mean it's this archive is unbelievable you you would mentioned that you would want to debate Lou Elizondo oh I'd be happy to I mean someone brought that up a couple years ago I don't have any animus towards him personally I just know what his role and function is because I was I was given a heads up on it as soon as he emerged out of the Pentagon uh and stood up his operation with this young guy I used to hang with Tom Delong a blink 182. he'd stand up my house in Virginia but um what do you expect counterintelligence and and disinformation agents to do is to do exactly that remember all that happened when our documentary unacknowledged which you can still see on Amazon Prime and everywhere reached about 750 million viewers at that point they said this we need to take this narrative acknowledge that these are real but then change the narrative from the truth which is what we're putting out to sort of a fantasy or or sort of a diversion and then those folks like Chris Mellon and Nick Pope and elizano would go up on Capitol Hill whisper into the ears of folks like Senator Rubio of the intelligence committee and others basically telling them false information but the false information works when you can put it around something real now what was the real thing the Tic Tac you know that the F-18 Hornets chasing off the coast California those events that happened that the the footage was leaked it was a vehicle for them to attach that false narrative to it okay so you have to understand how uh counterintelligence and psychological warfare operations are designed It's very effective I mean you know it is very effective I would say ninety percent of people who studying UFOs got gas lit certainly the US Congress and the media did so it's they're very good at doing it uh it doesn't mean that it's right but I'd be very happy to go Tera Ted on that with anybody let's talk about well I'd love to host that by the way great so do it uh yeah maybe we can get something going um although I have to tell you he he's called me a terrorist which I find rather funny oh boy here we go here we go hey I've had 30 years of defamation of my character so I'm I'm I'm sort of bulletproof from it you know yeah Stargate program during your last interview I saw a lot of comment there's two programs that I would like you to explain before we dive into the uh to the nuts and bolts of what we're going to um a lot of questions about the Stargate program can you Enlighten us well you'd have to describe it that name is not a code word that I've been introduced to from a reliable Insight source person who knows okay so here's just to give you an idea of my discipline I appreciate the honesty thank you so if somebody has told me about an operation whether it's a code word code numbered or just a general project that I know has the credentials and we know he was involved directly firsthand not second third fourth hand gossip over the internet then I will speak to that but now they if you describe to me what people think Stargate is I can comment on whether it's got any legitimacy well from what I've read uh people are saying that the Stargate program is doing some kind of experimentation with kids oh well I mean that's it has a different name but absolutely that's true and as you know Mr Herrera the Marine who was at our conference who I think you'll be speaking with soon uh no he came across such an operation he initially thought they were transporting in this man-made UFO drugs they'd certainly had weapons illegal weapons that they were Disturbed Distributing but those crates that are forensic Aerospace artists Drew or we had a a knock who was there who had been involved in operation after that and those were transporting children and women and certain men who had certain capabilities that would be used in experimental projects here and in other countries it's a monstrous program there's a man who lives right near here who was a CIA operative and was very young was one of these victims of this and he wants to come forward but he's quite frightened he's already signed affidavits about it 160 uh not far from Nashville that was involved in some of these operations mostly drugs and Drug running but also trafficking so it's a human trafficking operation it's part of Stargate yeah but you have to understand what it's for it's not for you know shits and giggles excuse me it's uh there it's rather I have to say some of these projects I mean they're very disturbing and I don't know how much people want to hear this but oh they want to hear it will keep you awake at night I mean if you have children like I do and but they're used in very specific operations and they were so they're selected for certain capabilities particularly PSI capabilities okay um and those are used in projects that these illegal projects are running for the purpose of [Music] um communication so what's coming to my mind right now is remote viewing yes is that involved in this it's but in a very high-tech way technologically most of the subjects die as a consequence of what they're made to do but they have certain aptitudes and abilities for which they are screened and then they are abducted and taken now keep in mind this is also there are a lot of of operations that have related to this um you know recently there was a whistleblower came out I was talking about the aliens murdering humans and he was referring to a case that I know for a fact were our uh operations these illegal secret government operations that were down in South America and they've done it in Africa also where they have killed innocent people in villages to make it look like an alien attack now that information is being now provided to Congressman Tim burchett and the Senate intelligence committee as if those were extraterrestrial events they have no idea it's our guys doing it I'm trying to I'm trying to get Tim on the show no he's great I've met with him he's he's in this heart and soul here's the risk though and if anyone in Congress is watching I I want to word this very carefully a little knowledge is of extremely dangerous thing here because this is a hall of smoke and mirrors and deception and you have to then wind this back what would a clandestine operation have if unsupervised since the late 1950s where they've had the most some of the most brilliant scientific Minds I've ever met working these projects they've had almost an infinite amount of money trillions of dollars that have gone into the r d studying both human breakthroughs and also extraterrestrial Vehicles propulsion systems communication systems Material Science what things are made of how they're made well you figure after 80 years of that trillions of dollars you're going to have some payoffs and these payoffs are in the form of advanced at Advanced Technologies and arbs alien reproduction vehicles that are the man-made ones but also this whole area of nanobiotechnology uh Consciousness and mind interface Technologies all manner of weapon systems that are what are called scalar or longitude and will go faster in the speed of light it's like an EMP but on steroids it has uh instead of a wave like this for electromagnetic it's a straight line that goes out longitudinally called scalar and those are faster from speed of light they can be used for Interstellar Communications but they can also be weaponized they've been weaponized so they're all manner there's a whole constellation again of Sciences and Technologies and the you know the CIA Science and Technology guys I've met with some of them that are so far beyond what let's call it the the white world that the legal government uh including Lockheed Northrop Grumman my my uncle never worked on this stuff he worked on the lunar module landed on the moon the first time it was my mom's oldest brother and his whole career was with Northrop Grumman he was never read into this other end of it so that one of the things people have to keep in mind most of the people in the military CIA Special Operations uh corporate what have you who work in that world are not part of some vast uh conspiracy it's incredibly tightly held but that's her that's in my view that's her Achilles Hill by definition it has to be kept pretty small pretty tight which makes them vulnerable if we'll get to this later if the U.S government actually has the will to go the distance to get this under control and if they need to get it under control fairly quickly because it's getting out of hand let's talk about project bluebeam can you describe what that is well that's another subculture term that's been attached to a series of projects that involve what the Pentagon what they call a deceptive indication and warning or a false inw which is a false flag and it's the ability to Stage through very Advanced Technologies an alien attack or an alien event and it's a whole series of them now what most people don't know about since 19 late 50s early 60s like the Barney Hill case and all that um those were all human assets abducting innocent people made to look alien and so that psychological warfare uh began was authorized in the lit in 1953-54. 1954 we mastered gravity control so we started deploying these assets to begin to condition the public that there's a scary threat from outer space I mean look at Hollywood alien you know Ridley Scots the movies uh if you want to see a script for what's coming fairly soon look at the movie Independence Day okay it's right at a Central casting for this covert group uh so whether their whole purpose is to create sort of a global militarized totalitarian superstate of the world fighting another world it's like War of the Worlds okay and that's been a 70-year defense plan and I know people have seen that plan Carol Rosen saw the plant who was Werner Von Brown spokesperson who's on our team and she's almost 80 now but brilliant mind and you know when she realized in the 70s that this was what was afoot she her whole life was devoted to trying to get some of these projects under control but you're you know we're little David's up against the enormous Goliath um and nevertheless you know the truth that people want the truth he might want Gloria Steinem said the truth will set you free but first it'll piss you off um but it's time for people to you know actually realize that this is something they have to take seriously so there are now if you add those capabilities to holographic capability scalar weapon capability space time systems where you can alter and sort of alter the flow of space-time in an area which gets into some really as a CIA they call this wsfm Weird Science and freaking magic my uncle's company I met an engineer that dealt with this stuff a couple years ago and he said we just call it pfm pure [ __ ] magic excuse my language but that he says literally that's what we call it so you're dealing with technologies that are and this is the problem I call it the big technology gap between what conventional Pentagon Special Forces joint staff Senate Intel armed services house until the president National Security people what they know and what this group has so what they know it's like this is you know just to make this real for people when I was briefing uh years ago the Admiral in charge of J2 joint uh intelligence for Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Wilson and that memo leaked out where he was debrief by Dr Davis and everyone went oh my God and it states when I was there for a stand-up briefing and what they don't know is that at the end of it I asked the Admiral to help us get to this is 97 this is 26 years ago and he said well I don't know how I'm going to help with something when the best technology I can deploy we can deploy is a B2 stealth and this other group have objects that can do circles around the b2s and he acknowledged that to me I said well that doesn't mean you can't he says well I can't unless it's authorized I said well word you need the authorization well he felt he needed authorization from the sect deaf who had already been waived off and the president which was Clinton at the time who had also I have a very interesting story since I saw you but we knew that Clint had been approached by George H.W bush and told butt out this is none of your business dealing with the UFO issue because this was one of the very first things Clinton wanted to know about because I knew people who live at the White House with him um you know he he was very keen on getting to the bottom of it but the efforts he launched were torpedoed and he eventually backed off of it interesting yeah yeah I know that whole story it's it's an ugly story of corruption and power being abused but uh but he did initially want to really find out what was going on and it was a sincere effort and there was an entire special operation stood up around getting getting that but I have a very famous Hollywood agent and a superstar who was in a limo with um they don't want to use their names uh with with Clinton whenever he left office and they asked about the UFO issue and the president said oh yes he says but they I was told by George H.W bush that this was none of my business and butt out and it was made very clear you're just you're you're only the president you get the drift so you know now obviously if we're going to have a constitution the rule of law and a Democratic Republic that kind of thing cannot stand but because of the power and the money behind this group it has stood and you know years ago in 93 I was at the Wrigley Mansion and I'll tell you Sean it's a very interesting meeting it was like late at night 10 11 o'clock at night it was a conference room full of suits and they approached me and this is um the fall of 93. just before I brief CI director Woolsey and they said look you don't need to be talking they knew all about this meeting that was going to happen and I you don't need to be talking to the president and and the CI director about this they don't know anything and they're not going to know anything if you want to know you talk to us we're the wfo we're the work for other contractors we're the people who are working on these Technologies and doing the technology transfer and then they were trying to convince me to side with what they were doing and I said no I said this is a corrupt Enterprise and then he offered that he says you're a doctor you can take out as many credit cards as you want we'll zero them out each month because we run the super computers that back up the entire banking system and we can get an infinite amount of money through certain techniques and so we'll just zero them out I said then you're going to own me aren't you because it's in that credit card fraud and banking fraud he says no we're just trying to help you say healthy this is an absolutely true story you put me under sodium pentathol lie detector but at the end of it he said look we have given it Lee this is now remember this is 30 years ago we have given at least 10 000 people 10 million dollars a piece or more to secure their cooperation with this project wow and that was 30 years ago now money is no object if you're printing the stuff up and you're running drugs and you're trafficking and you're siphoning off from the legitimate black budget which there is a legitimate budget that's overseen by the president and the key people in in the Congress we're totally legitimate but a lot of money from that is siphoned off and is through overbilling to the government into these illegal projects it's absolutely embezzlement so we can prove this by the way and I have people who've seen it happen okay but I think that when you look at that and you go okay well this is where the center of power is the center of power is not in Congress and it's not in the white house and it's not in the legal constitutional government or the main part of the Pentagon or agency it's in this group and it's amassed so much power and wealth and technology that it is and I'll be blunt a threat to all life on Earth it's a threat it's way greater threat than China or Iran or Russia ever and I think people have to take this what I just said very seriously because all these other skirmishes even if there were a couple nukes detonated there's nothing compared the risk this group poses given the Technologies they possess and the intention to use it in a malevolent way where they could Stampede the whole world although a trajectory that would be you know an Armageddon scenario so unfortunately these people are serious about it they're whacked out in my opinion one of the knock I recently met with he says yeah well even in this world then he's been in this uh super black dark world uh and very high up relatively high up mid-level anyway and he said the weight for the folks who are these really super Rogue operators the recruiter for being sociopaths or Psychopaths now he says I was recruited because I was willing to kill on behalf of the country or what's right but but not being a sociopath to do it for the good if you're going to use lethal force or any any technology these folks running these projects are a subset of people who are screened who are in fact sociopaths and Psychopaths I'm using this clinically as a doctor there's four and a half percent of the U.S population or sociopaths and Psychopaths so I mean and the ones that are high functioning are identified and moved over into these Rogue operations interesting yeah smart extremely smart yeah um let's take a quick break sure and then we're going to get into the disclosure project I don't know if I've ever been this excited to represent a brand I'm talking about first form I just align so well with what they've got first form is a supplement company they have just about every supplement you can possibly imagine all grade A stuff let's go through some of the stuff that uh some of my favorites all right here we go one Enduro performance this is a non-stimulant pre-workout mix guess what made in the USA protein sticks and the protein bar look I'm an entrepreneur I'm super busy I don't have time to go to lunch in fact I don't even know what a lunch break is this is my lunch for the most part then we got opta Reds 50. guess what also made in the USA so is the protein bar and the beef sticks actually but optored's 50 guess what guys beets super healthy for you guess what they taste like [ __ ] this doesn't Two Scoops throw it in there you get all the benefits of having beets with optoretz 50 then we've got protein everybody needs protein if you're not taking protein you should be especially if you work out my favorite chocolate banana guys let me tell you something else about first form the owner CEO Andy frizzella guy has made a phenomenal company true American Dream story started from absolutely nothing sleeping on a mattress in the back room of a very small shop now it's built an Empire check it out go to firstform.com SRS he's also put a culture into his company that this entire country could use right now gave me a ton of inspiration I used to listen to his podcast real as [ __ ] when I was building my first studio in the Attic of my house three and a half years ago right when the show started can you believe that now I'm repping the brand and if you haven't checked out their podcast you might want to like I said real as [ __ ] check it out I'm actually on there I do a pretty decent job but uh let me know what you think anyways once again go to firstform.com SRS and when you get there if you order 75 or more worth a product guess what you're getting free shipping but you're only getting that if you go to firstform.com SRS that's one s t p h o r m slash SRS ladies and gentlemen this is a real American company that aligns with all the values but America stands for check them out I want to tell you all about this new meat delivery service I found called moink what I really really like about moink is they are from a small rural Farm Town in Missouri LaBelle Missouri right by where I grew up and I love supporting small town business USA now when I started looking into moink they educated me on the meat industry and I want to share with you all a couple of facts according to moink magazine sixty percent of all pork is produced by one company in the U.S and that is 100 owned by the Chinese four companies control over 80 percent of the meat industry in the United States more than ten thousand different additives are allowed in the U.S food supply 99 of chicken 95 percent of hogs 78 of cattle in the U.S are raised in confinement buildings or feedlots means they're not moving around freely eighty percent of the antibiotics consumed in the U.S are fed to animals here's a stat in 2016 18.4 million pounds of antibiotics were sold for livestock and that's what you're eating suicide rates amongst farmers are the highest than any other profession and that includes veterans believe it or not I found that alarming now here's what moink is doing to combat some of this stuff which I really appreciate their livestock is 100 born and raised and harvested humanely in the United States of America their Farms practice regenerative agricultural methods they are free of GMOs antibiotics and all hormones their Alaska salmon is wild caught their beef and lamb are grass-fed and grass-finished their boxes ship from rural America right in Small Town Missouri love it they're chicken and pork our pasture raised so guys check them out moink keep America farming going by signing up at moinkbox.com SRS right now listeners on this show get free bacon

from the break I forgot to give you a gift every time the last time I forgot to do this it's okay we just get to go we get to go and then I get fast enough well thank you you're welcome oh a gift bag for winning the contest for the whatever it is I've done thank you you're welcome so those in there only got the vigilance Elite gummy bears oh good legal in all 50 states believe it or not and uh I got your hat too thank you let's move on so oh good you're gonna disguise me up now so I got a question from a friend of mine I tried to connect you guys I don't know if you guys connected or not but um my friend Chris Beck and um he just said an idea to run by you does this lie does this Theory line up with UFO sightings and then the question is is it easier to see UFOs in Grays in early hours one hour before Sunrise to an hour after Sunrise the ultraviolet of the sun is it little the ultraviolet of sun is highest in these hours see reppi's is hour before an hour after Sunset because infrared is highest in these hours well actually it really depends on what modality they're operating in so what that what that means is uh an Interstellar vehicle now it's distinguished between the ones that we have versus the ones that are Interstellar they can phase in and out of this say 3D instantaneously so you could have one right over your building right here no sensor would pick it up because it's actually shifted the frequency of it out of linear space time uh sort of so this is what I call trans-dimensional physics and then in an instant Nano second it could be 3D or it could be something in between so there's a little bit if you've ever had a rheostat for a dimmer switch or something you can make it brighter dimmer turn it all the way off so those Technologies allow for an object to be fully in 3D or shifted dimensionally literally out into another dimension and back now these are not interdimensional they're more trans-dimensional because their Origins are another star system there are also interdimensional objects and those are Things From Another Dimension that is not from the material Cosmos but they can be confused with some of the Extraterrestrial uh phenomena it's a very complex thing so in terms of seeing these objects I think people you know when it's not super bright uh in this with the sun you're going to see more an object that's going to be silhouetted than a bright bright sunlight okay um and the other issue I think is that the ones that we have can also operate in a way where they are a substantially have an electromagnetic field around them that can kind of cloak them but under certain lighting conditions and radiation let's call it infrared UltraViolets it depends on the condition you can get a glimpse of them as they're moving so I think that this gets into understanding the underlying technology and physics of how these objects work and that's why when we're doing our our Expeditions where we're going out making contact and looking we have a whole set of protocols and I train people and what to look for what the phenomenon might be you know if you're having cameras whether it's settings I don't do camera work and full disclosure I'm an idiot with cameras but um so that you have it set properly and what and also know what to look for uh but I think that the technology determines more than the time of day but the time of day might facilitate that's why I think when when it's still light but it's not bright light and that Spectrum you'll see an object more easily okay but I think it has to do with I don't think it has to do with the actual innate occurrence I think it has to do with what we can see what we can see with these things okay our eyes that makes a lot of sense when you're talking trans-dimensional what how do I even ask this when we're talking other dimensions what does that mean well the universe let's call it the cosmos you know it's it's described by astrophysicists as sort of this 3D thing now it if you look at uh quantum entanglement and the concepts of the universe being a holographic conscious entity which it is then you start talking about not just material but you're also talking about other dimensions that are at refined levels of frequencies and vibration so the speed of light the speed of electrons atoms what have you all of that would pertain to what we call the 3D three-dimensional if you were to cross over that in frequencies and this is again where you start getting into some very strange wsfm like I mentioned phenomenon then you're talking about other embedded dimensions but it's not like it's some distant place it's folded within so you know a hologram if you look at a hologram of Marilyn Monroe with her dress blowing up you know like that if you were to just zoom in on one little piece of that dress on the edge of the her skirt you and zoom in on it the entire image would be in there and zoom in again it's holographic so you have to kind of get your mind around the cosmos is this conscious Quantum hologram and so there are many many many dimensions not just this plane of three dimension uh that is all enfolded within it so a lot of the confusion happens where everything like something weird like a poltergeist event will be conflated with uh something extraterrestrial well it isn't you know it's it was someone who like in the ER I had this happen once some guy that was killed couldn't save him you know it was murder and he was angry and at three in the morning he started taking all the stuff out of the cabinets but he wasn't there it was just his Spirit weird stuff so that kind of phenomenon is an extraterrestrial it's interdimensional you see what I'm saying I do okay so I'm trying to do some very kind of crude analogies but the the confusion comes in is that if you're an Interstellar capable civilization which means you're going from point A in the cosmos to here B it's like if this were a piece of paper you're not going a straight line across the paper you're folding the paper being space-time okay and so these two points are here I'm enlightened now and so but in the process of doing that this sort of bending and altering space time you then bump up against and cross these other dimensions and this is sort of the intersection between what some people call metaphysics and physics or their conscious worlds and the worlds of light if you will the mystics we call astral and extraterrestrial Technologies and it's a very interesting intersection I I find that the most interesting part of this whole subject but it quickly you have to be CR you go in the Crazy Town way too quickly with a lot of people out there who don't know enough to talk about it intelligently in my opinion but it's also dangerous and here's why it's dangerous those capabilities can be technologically stimulated to occur it's like the Skinwalker Ranch after a certain sell of this covert group got hold of that thing they started setting up phenomenon there is absolutely man-made high-end Electronics but interdimensional it's like to show stranger things I've never seen it but it that's based on some weird stuff that went on at Montauk on Eastern Long Island the Montauk projects and we know what those are I know guys who've been in Laboratories where they have a torroid or one of these devices and suddenly they're pulling in spooky looking creatures they look like they came out of the ninth ring of hell and they they literally become 3D and are running around the lab weird stuff all right so the high end of the wsfm is is this sort of thing but that can be used in a deceptive indication and warning it can be used in a way that everyone on planet Earth would think that it's alien then it isn't I see what you mean okay so this is the real the real danger in all of this not being disclosed and known particularly by policy makers in the government and Pentagon all these folks is that they're not going to be able they're going to be so easily gas lit and deceived by people presenting all kinds of phenomena plural as extraterrestrial when it isn't because they have mastered the ability of this what's called stagecraft that's literally what's called in some circles and this gets back to this whole question of Project Blue beam where they could stage but what their capabilities are Way Beyond what most people think they are and I began working with some of these Geniuses back in the early 90s that I met who in late 1950s and 60s had figured this out so the electronics uh and the Very high-end electromagnetic field systems that can do this were unpacked pretty well by between 1955 and 1965 in that decade so this with the different dimensions is so there's another dimension in this room right now and we just can't within this folded it's the enfoldment it's quantum entanglement so you know what Einstein called the spooky effect you know where the same particle be in two places at once but but visualize that uh at every point in space and time at this level of quantum entanglement you have access to any other point in space and time but also these other dimensions up to and including the the most rarified what some people would call the the conscious being the unbounded consciousness it's all folded within this in what I call the real cosmology uh understanding the cosmology is Way Beyond astrophysics current astrophysics but but I think that's the part of this where when you start experimenting with and and reverse engineering and extraterrestrial vehicle their communication systems are not based on the speed of light like our cell phones right or video they're based on this understanding of the cosmos because they've lived for millennia in that understanding and so this is why you know we talk about the fact that they have technologies that interface with directed thought I call it a technology assisted Consciousness and Consciousness that assists the technology so they can interface bioelectric field and thought and they navigate the spacecraft [ __ ] really really cool stuff I mean you know Elon Musk is trying to do some stuff with neural link but he's still using wires and at the speed of light but the idea would be the same that your your thought could actuate to a technological interface that would then not only be used in communication because what's that the speed of thought versus the speed of light yeah but think about why that's so important if you're from the Andromeda galaxy which is two and a half million light years from here at the speed of light your cell phone it would take two and a half million years for a signal to get there and another two and a half million years for them to answer and you hear it it's five million years so when I when I when I talk about this I say there are certain technological thresholds you have to have crossed if you're an extraterrestrial Interstellar civilization those technologies have the good news is we we understand them and they could be used to great purpose on Earth energy generation healing all kinds of things Medical but right now they're in the hands of the worst group of sociopaths that have ever lived and they dwarf by far Stalin or Hitler in terms of their intention and their capabilities Way Beyond it's not the buffoonery of the Third Reich is the high-tech very dangerous end now this is this to me is as a doctor I tell people this is like a knife or so you know I can use a knife to put butter on my bread or I can use it to Slit your throat now so technology is neutral it's the it's the Consciousness and the intention of those who wield it who have it in this situation right now is the worst of all worlds because you have the most amazing wonderful Technologies in the hands of the worst group ever that that have quite a bit of malice an intention so this is what I think has to be fixed and that's that's why the disclosure project is trying to move this along first yes now we've established UFOs are real well that was known in the 50s 60s and 40s but now what's behind all that unpacking all the detail and the reason the scientific end of this is so important even for operations is that this group of illegal covert human projects they have surveillance communication systems Transport Systems and Sciences that are been Rich the week before he died told James Goodall you heard him at our conference last when the last man to talk to him he says anything that you've seen in Star Trek and can imagine we've done at the Lockheed Skunk Works and he said not at that not at Area 51 but at the desert base the underground facility let's get into the disclosure project for 100 plus years advanced technology has been seized isolated and hidden away this has suppressed the advancement of technology and human progress the disclosure project archives include government documents from the United States Canada Australia Russia and the UK 145 top secret facilities and base Maps 755 now witness accounts for military corporate and government sources 121 UFO crash retrievals yep that's all on our archive what is some of the 145 top secret facilities that you know about well you know everyone talks about Area 51 that's an old one um it's still operational and particularly you know S3 S4 uh Mesa um out in Groom Lake are these in the U.S yeah this is this no us no okay no that one um and that's operational has been since the 50s uh a more state-of-the-art one is actually in The dugway Proving Grounds which is in Utah is this the one that um you disclosed at the at the conference yes I'm gonna put a picture up of it right now and so uh that facility there's something called the Avery sector AV ery whether these assets there's an extraterrestrial vehicle that was being studied there when one of our Witnesses I think he was there in 2009. uh when that object had been downed they're they're down by these electromagnetic pulse weapons because the ET craft were completely electromagnetic so um you know a kinetic weapon would not be so effective missile or a laser but an electromagnetic pulse or scalar weapon stuns them and they'll come down sometimes they crash sometimes they're intact if they're intact then you have the whole thing to study and that's where this man it was in a facility where they had an entire intact one um and then uh you know there's a vast underground facility there so they're Downing these aircraft with basically a directed EMP weapon yes but a more sophisticated than the legal constitutional government would know about because you're going to add to normal EMP uh let's call it a uh a supercharged part of it that scalar what I mentioned before where it's a point that goes out longitudinally without the waveform okay so that's why you know light propagates at 186 000 miles every second these are not limited that way because it's a point that goes out straight line but see what I'm saying yeah so now you're bypassing you're exceeding the speed of light it's essentially teleportation less different we'll get into that if you want to that but no I'm talking about just a a type of energy weapon but it can also be used for communication and uh I think in the old days in the early 20th century mid 20th century there were people who stumbled across and Tesla wrote about scalar wait so hold on this isn't a this isn't a point A to point B line it's not linear it's not a linear weapon if I shoot a gun the bullet goes you can see it right you know and if I shot a laser you could see it you know travel from point A to point B are you saying that these weapons do not well they go from point A to point B but by passing a linear space time meaning they're they're in the entangled Quantum so quantum entanglement basically is where every point in space and time is connected through what's called quantum entanglement so when you have a Quantum scalar weapon then you're able to uh Target an object and multiples of the speed of light and those weapons are they're very dangerous because one of the things we have to be careful of is while these civilizations that are extraterrestrial and I mean to me they're the equivalent of Gandhi that they haven't struck back yeah at all but I'll be honest with you uh you know the more these weapons get perfected and you get into multiple generations of them the more humans are a risk to other planets if you watch this show at all you know I am a very big proponent when it comes to psychedelic therapy I have my own Journey it's helped me in more ways than I can even begin to describe in one sitting and I found this new company called Mind Bloom let me tell you about it there's no quick fix for anxiety and depression it's not finding a new therapist or starting an exercise routine not more and regular meditation or a better diet

the show right now just want to say thank you guys you are our top supporters and you're what makes this show actually happen if you're not on vigilance lead patreon I want to tell you a little bit about what's going on in there so we do a little bit of everything there's plenty of behind the scenes content from the actual Sean Ryan Show on top of that basically what I do is I take a lot of the questions that I get from you guys or the patrons and then I turn them into videos so we get right now there's a lot of concern about self-defense Home Defense crimes on the rise all throughout the country actually all throughout the world and so we talk about everything from how to prep your home how to clear your home how to get familiar with a firearm both Rifle and Pistol for beginners and advanced we talk about mindset we talk about Defensive Driving we have in end of the month live chat that I'm on at the end of every month where we can talk about whatever topics you guys have it's actually done on Zoom you might enjoy it check it out and if zoom's not your thing or you don't like live chats like I said there's a library of well over 100 videos on where to start with prepping all the firearm stuff pretty much anything you can think of it's on there so anyways go to www.patreon.com vigilance Elite or just go in the link in the description it'll take you right there and if you don't want to and you just want to continue to watch the show that's fine too I appreciate it either way love you all let's get back to the show thank you well with these weapons I'm trying to understand this yeah and I I think I have at least a grasp of quantum entanglement so what you're saying so so every every point of space and time is connected correct through whatever atoms we'll just I'll just call that yeah but with no time delay and so if I was to use one of these energy weapons let's just say from me to you six feet apart and I use this energy weapon at the exact same time to an object that's 75 000 miles away it'd be the same time interval it would be take them out same amount of time it would be the exact same amount of time right okay that's what I that's what I thought so so how does that differentiate from teleportation teleportation is actually the movement of an object from point to A to B okay okay not just the energy so you take this bottle and you don't go do it that way okay so it's it's in the same sort of again category of trans-dimensional physics and advanced physics and Technologies and the real action is in the electromagnetic and magnetic spin all of that and so the people who understand this that I've met with who've worked on these Technologies and have had them in their Labs um and I've been in some of these Labs is it fascinating uh technology and if it was used for something good I mean we'd have a whole new planet here I mean it'd be phenomenal beautiful wow well that's what the Lost Century the documentary that we just released is all about a hundred years of these sort of technologies that have been sequestered and confiscated and how if they were disclosed we would have a civilization uh well within your the baby's lifetime before he's in high school we'd have a world with no pollution no poverty and no energy issues in terms of energy shortage because you'd be pulling energy out of the fabric of space-time and the so-called zero point or Quantum vacuum from this Quantum level and that's what Tesla stumbled across I mean they didn't he didn't call it that because the physics of it weren't fully elaborated but he he saw the effect of it we're going to get into that that stuff we're going to get into the documentary for for now um back to the underground facility that's a big one at dugway it's the what this gentleman first hand had not been in it he's has the name of a scientist senior scientist US government that was at the dugway facility and he said that the complex that's underground goes out it's about 1300 square miles not Acres miles 1300 square miles yeah what's in there all this stuff the Technologies the crafts operations um we know that I had a man who was out there who had special night vision he was special operations and embedded but he was a scientist and he was out there and we hours there were these massive triangular objects with silent launching from that area but underground and would come out over the range no lights on them totally fully operational um and you know those are are one category of the man-made advanced technology platforms or alien reproduction Vehicles some people call them there are quite a few out there at dugway these government documents from the U.S Canada Australia Russia and the UK what are some of those documents oh they run the whole gamut for example I have a document it wasn't Declassified but it was provided to me by a source from Area 51 Nellis and it's uh it lists as of the early 90s uh I got it in the 90s uh all the code numbers and code names that were on a security alert because there were a group of civilians who were trying to spy on the Range where they had to shut everything down because there was a large group um and it was a security alert but it was an nro document National reconnaissance Office document and it had key names on it it had a magi on it the majority joint intelligence committee or magic it had Cosmic Ops on it Royal Ops it had Blackjack control on it it had key actionable intelligence and that's one of the documents I gave to some of the folks in the White House over the years or Pentagon because it's it's a legitimate document that actually gives specific code word and numbers uh that were out in that particular area and it's still there I mean it's not like you pick up an asset like that and move it to where um so we know where they are and that's why our 145 facilities uh I've just learned of a new one that we'll be putting on that map soon I'm supposed to be taken there where's this I can't say where but right now can we put the map up yes maybe put the map up you'll see many of them replaces people know they know Edwards Air Force Base but where um where do you go to uh at the Nellis range it's a huge range Air Force Base uh and then the Nevada Test Site which is the where we tested nuclear weapons going north but out there there's some very key assets and there's a Delta Force Helo base out there that's used for retrieving extraterrestrial vehicles and retrieving downed accidentally crashed uh man-made ones that malfunction so we have a man on our team who is on a retrieval operation initially for conventional aircraft jets for their classified components and then he got read into an operation retrieving the man-made ones which blue is mine the Raytheon and Northrop ones then he got read into the ones that are uh you know oh he was on one operation where we stunned one of these extraterrestrial Vehicles is when I showed at the event uh and it didn't crash it got stunned and landed out there on the Range and now the Nevada test range and they were moved in and hilos to retrieve it and um that interesting account of that uh it began to come back to life and uh an opening came out of it and it looked like a fruit roll-up came down and a couple of extraterrestrials emerged that he had he literally was in three or four feet of them we have the drawing of them of what they look like but what happened is that at that point that craft was being checked by uh helicopters in the air as well as one of these arvs man-made ones the Triangular when they this thing began to sort of glow at reddish and come to life boom our aircraft took off now the boots on the ground there and the choppers on the ground after a few minutes they were all I know this sounds like Star Trek they were all teleported back to the Helo base instantly holy [ __ ] yeah oh yeah they weren't harmed none of them were harmed but apparently this whole event convinced this particular operator to get out of that system because he knew what what he sensed from these et's was that they were completely benign very much here to help us and we were doing horrible things to them and they also said we know what you're doing we're not going to allow you to do this much longer it was sort of a warning that happened in 2000 and um but that was 2010 11 time period what's your goal with the disclosure project well our goal is first of all to get this information to the key policy makers and people in the government who have responsibility for our national security but also in other countries as well and to the public so that they understand the difference in my opinion between the false information being purveyed which is the dominant information that's out on the internet in Hollywood and shows and the real information that needs to be understood by the public so that the public isn't deceived so we have both an internal a governmental uh objective to guide the government and understanding this and getting them as much detailed actionable intelligence as possible like the details and this is how they've gotten this far the reason the bill that was just came out of committee and the intelligence committee is because they Now understand if you read that bill that has given sort of a Safe Harbor six months amnesty period for these corporations and people to come forward or they'll be prosecuted that is in the bill that left committee and I've been pushing for this for a long time the first time I recommended it was in 1993 to Bill Clinton and nobody wanted to do it now it's going to happen but that sets a clock and so the disclosure Project's objective is to give the legal government of the United States that we have allegiance to and the We the People the public the information so that these Rogue and very criminal activities can be brought under proper supervision and control Access Control and that's not the case right now and it's dangerous that it isn't so it's a very big step that first in December they signed this law allowing uh whistleblowers to come forward through the Pentagon process which is a top secret skiff situation but now this bill is going to explicitly state that these corporations anybody having exotic materials clearly referring to extraterrestrial type materials Technologies bodies those have to be disclosed and turned over to the legal US government or they will then be subject to prosecution criminally um so that's a six-month window now so that clock has started that's a six-month window yep and you're also going to make all of this which a lot of it already is open source information yes if we could get some you have to imagine myself and my wife and a few volunteers trying to scan organize eight ten terabytes of data and then create a database system that's searchable and then eventually get it on the internet now what we do have to redact the unredacted archive I'm giving to the top investigators in the Congress and the Pentagon group uh the White House got a redacted version because they're not really leaning into this much yet um I wish they should be but I have someone in the White House military office that that we're providing information to but um those the the redacted one just to be clear the only thing we're holding back are the personal names of these you know hundreds of whistleblowers who don't want their names known um except when there's certain conditions and also they're you know like they're if they have a DD214 I'm not going to release a non-secure manner so the the folks who have the unredacted those go into a scale if they go into a vault they have it now I will say on the record anyone who says the US government is not in possession of all the facts and the actual intelligence to get to the bottom of this is a liar or ignorant they're either a liar or they're ignorant because that was handed off three weeks ago all of it so there's actually no excuse now the only excuse they'd have now is that they're part of a cover-up in which case they should be prosecuted and I'm saying even the people in the Aero office in the Pentagon they either move on this and do it with Integrity or they should be prosecuted let's move into your new documentary The Lost Century sure it's all about advanced technology how it's been for a hundred how it's been around for over 100 years but kept secret Zero Point Energy yep a lot of people call free energy is also called the quantum vacuum this would basically eliminate the need for fossil fuels utilities yeah wins every every means to power that we have now would make it completely obsolete it would be unlimited clean and right free energy and we've had it for 100 years how do we so let's get into this how did you discover this stuff well it was an outgrowth of me looking into the the UFO UAP issue because once you realize these objects are real three-dimensional the very first question actually when I was when I go up uh to Capitol Hill or someplace I'll put up the footage the footage that the Pentagon said this is a real 3D object infrared sensors no heat no Jets no rockets and certainly no nuclear power plant on it because I mean those things are hot right there I have been nuclear-powered aircraft and satellites but I said how is that moving at those speeds and then straight up against gravity this is the alternative energy and propulsion systems so I always tell people forget all the mythology and everything it's an Alternative Energy System now it's a very Advanced one because it also flies now to be to be really clear I am not advocating not the release of the things that fly yet why it's a missile delivery system so you don't really want to open source an electrogravidic anti-gravity system that allows terrorists in Mogadishu to get a dirty bomb over downtown DC in two or three seconds right no no but the things that would sit at your house like your heat pump all right or in the hood of your car that would run your car or your factory or your business or your home those devices that are not things that fly those are just pulling energy from the fabric of space-time around it and physicists have estimated that the volume of space in a coffee mug has enough potential energy to boil off all the oceans of the world is that much latent energy so tapping into it to run the entire United States the whole world be like taking a thimble of water out of the Great Lakes so it is what you know Tesla called it the infinite energy field and it began to be discovered if you look at it all the way back but it as soon as you step into the reality the three-dimensional reality of these uh uaps and UFOs you immediately begin talking to people and this is what happened to me in the early 90s the people who know the physics of the energy systems because these things are not using oil gas coal nuclear whatever you so it's a it's a natural extension of the problem and I point out to people one of the central reasons for the secrecy that got out of control under Eisenhower's late last four years as president was because once they realized how this works they realized the big industrialist and financial and Global money to People Banking this would be the end of that entire sector of the macroeconomic system well that would have been great if it had been transitioned before I was born in 1955 because look at the world we have now but it really could have started coming out in the early teens and 20s if you look at the documentary The Lost century the sub caption is and how to reclaim it we talk about how we need to come together as a people and develop these energy generation systems and open source them meaning that it's no patent no intellectual property held back at the first level of this because the patent office will seize it we prove that in the documentary we have a national security order on a patent that a scientist I know submitted we took his name off of it so the question is are there some people who can financially uh put up the funds and it needs to be a substantial amount you know 50 to 100 million to start to create a high energy physics lab that develops this and gets it out to the public no intellectual property hold back or if there was that much funds we available we could go to some of these scientists who probably have these and say look we want to just acquire this you'll be here's 10 million dollars now go and relax let us move this out to the public you can't do it most of these engineers and scientists and inventors think they're going to do it the way they do a new software program and they're going to try to monetize it through uh intellectual property protections and patent you cannot do that with this because the system is so completely weaponized and corrupt and I'm talking from the patent office on that the only way to do it is to do an open source release of it massively through the internet blockchain so that's what we're doing but the technology if you go if you look at this documentary you'll see this trajectory there's a a great photograph with Nikola Tesla with this engineer farmer self-taught guy I believe was 1908 or 1902 the caption and this guy had like an earth battery had some uh metallic stakes and wires in the ground he was pulling resonant and it was running his farm wow night I mean my even my father you know I wasn't alive he was born in 1916. this was before my dad who was hand-to-hand combat in World War II with the Japanese amphibious Landing unit uh but you know I'm going what the heck you know we have our planet half the planet's population doesn't have indoor plumbing three billion people have no way to cook their food they're cutting down the rainforest three billion the biosphere even if you don't think climate change is real five million people die from breathing particulate matter soot all over the world from this noxious stuff we keep burning so we need to take care of our creation the Earth and our future and it isn't going to happen with a windmill and a solar panel believe me no way you're going to run 8 billion people off of those Technologies we're going to have to have Innovative high-tech solutions to the energy and environmental and poverty problems I mean look you know I just want to backtrack on that real quick when you're talking about people dying from from inhaling these particles and these chemicals and [ __ ] I mean you know this is this unfortunately is a touchy subject you know the the pollution and I in climate change and all this [ __ ] but what I can attest to that is 100 fact is what you just said because I've been to these parts of the world yeah I've spent over a decade in these parts of the world and you see one you see all these veterans coming home dying of weird cancers from [ __ ] that they breathed in overseas and and I can tell you in the wintertime the winter time in Afghanistan the soot is so thick in the air that if you go outside for I mean we're talking just five minutes and you go back inside and spit and spit in the sink or spinning whatever blow your nose you're you're you're going to spit gray right and but those fine particles get into your lungs and then your circulatory and heart and cause a huge number of problems not just cancers but I'm talking heart lung disease so why are we doing that when these technologies have existed now this same corrupt organization because it doesn't just deal with one issue have been responsible for basically hoovering up vacuuming up all these Technologies for 100 years I know people personally personally who have been murdered because they had one and it's because a very against my advice AMA against medical advice against their own security interests they want to keep a secret and they thought they were going to be so clever and they were going to out Fox this big super state of thugs I'm going dude you have no idea what you're up against here and then they think they're going to do encryption and keep it secret I'm going oh my God you think this group needs to worry about an electromagnetic encryption when they can Target a volume of space anywhere and extract anything being said I mean I mean it's you know and it's I understand it because if you're in the normal engineering world it's hard to believe it but I said you know if you don't believe it just wait you're going to be dead or it'll be confiscated then I you know you're only you're lucky if all they do is come in and kick your door in hit you with a national security order and drag it off you know that's your best outcome that's your best case scenario if you do it the conventional way so I go look you know the hip's like what is that same attributed Einstein the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result the reason I can prove that the strategy most people use doesn't work is that we can prove these technologies have been around for over a hundred years and you and I are still tied into a coal-fired or gas-fired power grid right so if the strategies if this if the conventional Business and Technology strategies were going to work they would have worked before you know you and I were born so we need to think we need to have different thinking about this strategically so what we're saying is all of these Technologies if they're used for peaceful purposes would really give us a whole new civilization beautiful uh now the downside is given what humans are we like to take any new technological breakthrough and weaponize it but the truth is they've already done that we've already weaponized these things how do you think that these I mean the anti-gravity technology that's using gravity as a power source how is that happening can do you have a brief explanation on I I really think it's gravity control and gravity Wave Control uh as for a power source I think the power source was better described as this Quantum vacuum energy or Zero Point Energy but if you so there's it's like two separate things but are related so you can have a Zero Point Energy System or a free energy system it doesn't move and it's not affecting gravity but at a certain resonant frequency and power and has to do with uh vortices toroidal energy patterns you can then cause what's what I call Mass cancellation where an object literally takes on weightlessness now if you go back in the documentary we touch on this all the way back to beef no tea Townsend Brown and what was later called the B Phil Brown effect in the late 1920s he took a very high voltage system at a very certain with wires around a crystalline material and it levitated just floated now that was almost 100 years ago late 20s that was then the Kowski Frost experiment in Germany around the same time confirmed it later the whole b-filled Brown effect studying very high voltage vhv systems began to be increasingly studied and classifying the 30s and 40s by the time World War II ended Adolf Hitler had a disc shaped electrogravidic but it wasn't stable which is why he could never use it in the war but it was brought back to America by Paul Mellon and uh Patton General Patton and Alan Dulles but so that device actually became a very important object to study at the end of World War II and of course it also that technology got Advanced greatly by studying the Extraterrestrial materials that we also were beginning to acquire by using electromagnetic weapons to down the ET craft so you had two rivers of Technology being developed from the 20s 30s 40s that intersected with the Extraterrestrial Technologies and they hybridized them [ __ ] so that's what happened between 1945 and 55 that decade how many different ways do you think is is how many different ways are there to harness this kind of energy oh I think there are dozens how did how did Tesla do it Tesla I think was actually capturing resonant magnetic field energy of the Earth that's almost boundless so there are a lot of quote free energy approaches I think the ones that use these very high voltage systems that create a sort of a vector a tap as it were into this uh Quantum vacuum energy and Zero Point Energy field those began to be stumbled across but sort of episodically as a phenomenon back in the late 1800s because that was the Heyday when they were first discovering electromagnetism and I think Maxwell and fair some of these guys stumbled across this but they didn't know what it was you're getting more energy out than you had to put in so I think you can have a rotational coil based device Floyd Suite who we feature in in the movie had a solid-state device that was about this big that could run a 300 horsepower electric engine for your car no other batteries the little teeny uh yeah that was you had video of that and yeah we had a video of it it was tested by a lieutenant colonel uh Tom Bearden who's a very dear friend of mine just passed away um he handed off all of what he knew about this to us we have a um file that was a CIA operative named sajaki that I knew but he had a guy I know named John bedini who um was allowed to copy a bunch of confiscated patents uh and we have that disc so we need to send up a research lab to do this and get to the bottom of it I think Sean very quickly because we need to do it look if this technology came out in the next year or two by a group that could just put it out open source it thousands of companies would then adopt it and we'd be able to really transform the trajectory of of the planet now they're going to be certain losers in that process like any new technology oil gas coal centralized Public Utilities they'll all have to be retired but keep in mind it's going to take 15 years to do this you know your car in my car running if if you have a conventional vehicle 100 million vehicles are made a year they're one and a half billion Motor Vehicles on the road worldwide that's 15 years if you waved a magic wand and converted every manufacturing entity to a zero point Electric System that's not going to happen so you know it's going to take a couple of decades to make this transition anyway it should have happened 100 years ago why do you think so many UFOs spottings are are happening around these nuclear sites well we know the answer to that and of course he didn't get to go into a lieutenant colonel Heckert who is the YouTube pilot who was there he dealt specifically with this in in information dealing with the uh extraterrestrial concern over nuclear facilities and it's multiple reasons one they're very concerned that we would actually do something that could threaten the life of biological life on Earth obviously Mutual assured destruction would do that and believe it or not these civilizations are very positively concerned with the human future but they're also secondarily maybe equally concerned about containing the warlike nature of humans from being exported out into space now the nuclear issue when you detonate a nuclear device or there's an accident everyone knows what an EMP is we've talked about electromagnetic pulse there's also a type of scalar pulse that goes out that literally rips through space-time that disrupts Interstellar communication and travel this is why you know I was talking to Gordon Crichton who is an MI6 guy in a military intelligence guy in the United Kingdom he's passed away but he's one of our Witnesses he used to publish fine salsa review that uh Prince Charles and Prince Philip subscribe to interesting but what he said was basically when we did that at the first atomic bomb explosion it actually was like kicking a hornet's nest because now teller Edward Teller and Oppenheimer they didn't know that when one of those things would go off that it would create this kind of pulse not electromagnetic pulse but this other wave that actually goes through the entangled Cosmos in a way that is highly disruptive to other civilizations Communications and travel so this began to be a huge red flag went up over the Earth warning this is a group of or you know primitive emerging civilization that is a a threat to themselves and a threat to others out there they don't even know the health threat what a big threat this is so the whole nuclear issue is what caused the modern era of UFO ET related events to take place because I think they've obviously been watching the Earth and and been involved and seen its development for Millennia there's good evidence for that I mean they're cave their cave drawings from five thousand years ago they've been carbon dated to that age that show a classic disc and with look like E.T beans outside of it from France and India and all over so I don't think it's it's not as if they didn't know we were here is that when we hit that point and what they really were trying to get Truman and Eisenhower to do the ETS were to wind that down and go on a different trajectory which is what we're recommending Now 60 years later and that is to Pivot to getting rid of this conflict-oriented endless war scenario with these kind of weapons and move towards a peaceful solution to our conflicts but then begin to adopt these Technologies so that human civilization can advance without cannibalizing the Earth and killing off the oceans so I think this is something that we took a pass on it was a tragic error the big error happened on here I'm just be honest with you pretty much the year I was born ironically 1955 to 57 this whole Enterprise went sideways and when Eisenhower subsequently lost control over these deep Black Operations that's when he gave the beware the military-industrial complex I mean he was very pro-military he was a general World War II and and then of course that's why also the first director one of the early director CIA 1947 when the CIA was founded Admiral Roscoe hillenkeeter stated in a letter to the New York Times after Eisenhower gave that speech and he said the secrecy around UFOs is a threat to the National Security he didn't say the UFOs were he said the secrecy around it is a threat to the National Security so when people ask me are the UFOs a threat to the National Security I said the man-made ones absolutely are the Extraterrestrial ones aren't but the secrecy around it and it's aggregate is a dire threat to world and national security no question in the documentary you talk about some of the UFO technology the metal is so pure cannot be replicated can you expound on that a little bit Yeah so we think you know if you're driving a car or flying on a Boeing 737 or whatever we dig that stuff up you know aluminum and metal we smelled it refine it roll it put it together rivets welding Etc an extraterrestrial vehicle and all its components are not made that way they are made by creating a sort of ultrasonic very high-tech wave that pulls let's call it the substrate the Elementals that are subatomic together on if you can visualize this like almost like a blueprint and energy and it materializes it so it's seamless the even the the parts that are in it anything that's energy or electronic related is on a nanomolecular level entwined in it but this is why it's very hard to study this stuff I mean it's not like taking apart a Soviet Mig or something I know the men who worked on these projects and I mean you're dealing with really extraordinary elegant beautiful uh Material Sciences and matter and that's why the materials are so pure because they're not dug up and refined they're actually assembled from this Baseline uh energy matter interface in space-time and you give it make it real for you there was a captain on a Navy contract vessel back in 62 or three and before he died he contacted me great guy um and he had been you know they were testing the atlas rockets for intercontinent ballistic but these didn't have nukes on them they were testing the rocket and guidance systems back way back and they had had a lot of UFO signings because the ETS were watching how we were developing and kind of this breakout speed with thermonuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic Cold War and one night they had an object on radar it was triangulated they had on ship radar so his the captain has this guy say hey look we have this boogie and then it got confirmed from their the command center uh and they said oh when they because they were able to do that Unfortunately they triangulated it and it was hit with some kind of weapon this was 63 and it dropped Boom Like a Rock right into the South Atlantic ocean so he was vectored over to the estimated point of impact and was there to retrieve it and I have his whole story and he never wanted to come forward because even when he had had surgery once they had an intelligence guy in there when he was on our anesthesia be sure he didn't talk about this but I have his whole information so what happened is that when he got to the site there was about a six by six pod and they towed it up on the ship uh and it wasn't the whole craft the whole craft had gone down but apparently there was some sort of one moded thing and there were four uh I'm gonna use his language little men that look like the color of a sicilian kind of brown but 39 inches tall uh no hair and also no external ears no no Pena flaps very fine feature but he's the reason he contacted me and this is why this is so funny you know I've debriefed a thousand over a thousand men like this he said I can't figure out how they got in and out of their uniforms so they had a one-piece uniform now no zipper and no buttons and no visible way they could get him out of this thing hmm he says how they put them on I said well they don't they don't need a zip or a button because they are kind of materialized around them and then dematerialized off using this technology this very Advanced trans-dimensional physics and he went oh my God I would have never drank I said no I mean it is how they're doing it so this is why people who encounter an actual ET craft or the ET the ebens Extraterrestrial biological entities and they see even their clothing none of it tracks because it's so far Advanced well you know there was another um you may have a camera if it was one or two of the whistleblowers that spoke about this they spoke about or maybe it was you talking about it but um when they got into the craft the inside of the craft seemed almost infinite yep yep that was that was one of them I was representing a whistleblower who is not ready to be unmasked yet he's still doesn't want to be known publicly but yes because you have a dimensional space shift as well so an object that looks 30 feet across you go in and it was so big you could if you'd throw in a football you couldn't hit the other side of it uh so you know again all of this gets into an understanding of physics uh that unfortunately you know we're not teaching our kids the real physics the science of anything I mean we're all locked 100 years this is the other part of the Lost Century I talk about is that it has to do with medical Technologies I mean as a doctor I've seen some things that my God if we had that the lives that could be saved spinal cord regeneration regeneration of lost limbs you've seen that stuff yeah at an underground lab on the Mexican Texas border sad how are you getting access to this the people who like what I'm trying to do that are in the system take me and I went to one place a very funny story and they all you know they had the Marines there you know there's all these checkpoints and and the guy said finally we got to the last one and this was a facility I don't see where it was but I mean basically world war three for all submarines to be run out of there and he the my middle my escort my military advisor finally we got to this last point where you go into the inner you know it's this huge Place deep and the guy goes and what does Dr Greer uh hear for and he says you don't have a need to know so he played this the same need to know thing who went in so I'd be on full disclosure I've never worked for the government or a contractor I have no clearances I don't want a clearance uh but there are people who know that what we're doing we're fighting the good fight and the people in the system a lot of them are very good people this is why a lot of people need to understand they got trapped in a system where you get read into more and more of these compartments next thing you know you're in something and the guys one thing as I say this I want to make a call for more whistleblowers watching to come out there are guys out there watching your show Delta Force Navy SEAL uh people in Aerospace industry various military commands that have dealt with or seen this and they need to come forward because now there's a safe pathway for them to do it and if you're corporate now there's a six-month clock on you and we we let me be very clear we know who you are and where your assets are and after those six months you're subject to criminal prosecution and you'll be lucky if that's all you're subject to so this is something this is getting very serious right now that's why I'm on your show there's this there's a six month window yep when does that expire from the date this bill is finally signed I mean is that a committee it's going to be voted and then it'll be its Amendment to the intelligence Bill okay so it's not actually we're not always up with that no it is it's done it's pretty much it's done but it's not in effect yet uh all right I'll have to ask my guy who's shepherding it through oh God yeah um I think it is actually let's talk about the secret air show in 1988 Norton yeah Air Force Base it's a decommissioned Air Force Base California um where there was uh the original uh ARB that we learned about uh apparently it had Mercury component parts from 1959 60 time period and it was sort of a circular object came up to it like a cupola you see the drawings we have and we have a man who was at that air show who described it in full it had Scorch marks and other things on it and they had been told at this secret air show that it in fact had been uh out in the solar system out in the space and back this is late 1950s early 1960s now ironically my uncle worked on the lunar module put the first man on the moon that was 1969. so they're working one track at Grumman which became Northrop Grumman and but then in these deep black projects they have these things that are zipping out there and that is 100 true my understanding it did not have Interstellar capability it did not have teleportation capable it doesn't have any of that really exotic but it was a energy free and free energy combined with anti-gravity where if they could get that up there and go out in the space and other places so that air show [Music] um was basically showing some old antique ones right this 1988. this this bird was from the late 50s or 60s and they had three of them one was uh about 25 feet I believe 150 and 100 feet across now you know Mr Herrera by the time he was in you know 2009 whenever it was in Indonesia that one was 300 feet across man-made think of it think of the length of a football field round floating how are you just how are you able to tell which one of these a man-made versus E.T at a great distance you wouldn't know uh if you're up close enough the man-made ones are going to have components protrusions electromagnetic often they're going to be seams welding marks uh underneath or could be pipes and other things it's very clearly a man-made machine the Extraterrestrial ones seamless they're they're they're they're extruded in this process of how they create them uh even the light they give off is very different because it's coming through so it's pure Material Science extremely pure materials uh and then if you don't have we're still in the infancy stages compared I'm sorry we're still on the infancy stages of this compared to I'm afraid in 2023 we're certainly not in infancy we we have we have Technologies and Material Science that are far beyond look at what uh Stephen digna talked about that Raytheon device out of a million people who would have seen or touched that thing one million of them would have said it was extraterrestrial no one would have thought we had that kind of Technology AI organic quality to it uh that if you look at his testimony carefully uh but that's how they've been getting away with doing the abductions the quote alien abduction hoax the way they've been able to do it is have Technologies and also creatures that are look like they're gray or reptilian or whatever they're I know men who've worked on them actually fabricated them those are man-made uh and they're used for their psychological warfare of purpose this is one thing I would love to get Dr Jacques will later release this document he has from 1985. it's a CIA official document and it describes the CIA conducting abductions alien abductions in Brazil and Argentina quote for their psychological warfare value now this is now what almost 40 years ago 38 years ago so this those sort of projects aside from being a crime in any jurisdiction anywhere on the planet uh and a crime against humanity is creating this false flag psychology the preparation because people are brainwashed thinking the aliens are mutilating and the aliens are abducting us they have no need to do that those that's this disinformation campaign using incredibly high-tech technologies that we've studied from the extraterrestrials so this is one of the real problems is that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing and this was my concern when when uh David Crush started talking about an event where you know the aliens were murdering people I'm going and that went all through Capitol Hill I'm going I know that incident that was us so people and I don't think he he understands because he's a young man the problem of having a little bit information on this and thinking you know a lot is that you're going to step into a booby trap and the booby trap is being played by the very unconstitutional criminals that people like him were trying to uncover you're working with garage correct we had met uh in March of 2022 in Culpepper Virginia I was asked to meet with him but uh and he had a security guy there with him and uh I told him look I'll cooperate and get you anything you need and so over about a 14 month period until he told me he was leaving the US government in April of this year we would you know periodically occasionally we spoke through an encrypted system usually it was encrypted texts but I have all these this is this is correct me if I'm wrong this is the guy that he was just in the news yeah and he did and uh came out that there was a down craft we retrieved it right with with bodies correct yes and those were a lot of this information I was providing to his bosses and then he was on a he was in a field operation to go out and get to places now he never got in to see it firsthand but he talked to people of course that that knew about it I mean this actually had the mainstream media yeah correct yeah yep so you know he was not the he's not the principal person I've been dealing with um the principal person would be the equivalent of a two or three star general if he was still in the military but but I think that you know we I try my goal in all of this is that if someone is trying to do this on behalf of the legal government of the United States I will give them any information I have uh but we have a lot I mean our repository of Intelligence on this by far is the largest in the world certainly exceeds the legal government of the United States I will say that for a fact now my concern is is that when you go from that to then falling into the clutches of folks in the UFO Community who then start giving you these tall tales of all these horrible things the aliens have been doing I'm going yes but you haven't been read in to that part of the project so this is like an onion a stinking onion pill 500 layers of this onion back and there's 500 more and this is where a little bit of just superficial knowledge is a very dangerous thing extremely dangerous and my concern about that is that this is exactly the game that's going to be run on Congress in the White House well I mean you're already seeing it I mean yeah like I said this look I don't I don't trust the mainstream media I anyways well another asset of the of this group but absolutely a lot of people do and a lot of people don't put any legitimacy on anything unless Fox News CNN MSNBC ABC NBC right unless they touch it nobody right I'm not going to say nobody because there's a growing the population that doesn't believe in the mainstream media is just continuously getting larger it's probably half the population but don't you why do you think I mean that would be the biggest story in the world we were we've recovered in ET craft with bodies and every on every News Network they're all covering it and then just like that it's it's gone no photos no nothing what happened why do you think it just disappeared well we know why I mean in 2001 when we did the first national Press Club event we had a guy who was on a team that for several years in the 60s retrieved the Pilates and the craft and he spoke and he had all of his information there his name is Sergeant Clifford Stone he's an archive go look at it so the people we just had at the national Press Club a YouTube decorated a YouTube pilot who encountered these objects back in the 60s 70s 80s uh worked at the Lockheed uh operations and skunk work interface with Ben Rich directly personally he didn't get to go into that but these guys are all available to to give testimony these are firsthand David Rush was secondhand he never was principally involved Stephen digna their with and saw was with two Raytheon guys with these man-made Raytheon devices DC long was in an underground facility out on the Range 19 with it with some Delta guys took his dad in who was a contractor and they accidentally saw this system levitating 100 ton concrete block up in the air along with some giant Boulders absolutely true and we had people who were you know at uh other operations that we brought now those are all 100 every one of our 750 disclosure project folks are first-hand witnesses meaning that they weren't people trying to find out like David Rush was they're people who actually were in there interesting that the media won't interview them it is though if they really want to know the truth why would you want to talk to a field operator who didn't have first-hand information and skip over the people who actually touched the things solve them you see what I'm saying yeah so the public has to ask the question very quickly [Music] um how do we get the truth out I think we're asking everyone to write their member of Congress and their two senators and the White House as an activist responsibility as a citizen of the United States and refer to the National Press Club event and the disclosure project archive because we've sent all this in and say now we need to see action taken now whether the media the corporate media that's I honestly believe is controlled by this same corrupt Enterprise I mean doc they're definitely controlled I mean there's multiple there's multiple videos of them all reporting the exact same [ __ ] I mean right right it's it's ridiculous that anybody even watches it anymore well I mean it's staged and the problem with that they do have and this is the other big announcement if there are any attorneys listening we now have over 150 attorneys and legal professionals on our legal team and not only will they protect and defend any whistleblowers uh and the project but they also are we're moving quickly towards issuing a civilian Rico racketeer influence corrupt organization lawsuit who are going to be in the Target all these corporations and individuals you can't use a civilian Rico against a government agency but you can you can Target the individuals in the corporations that we are going to be doing in concert with this bill saying now you need to come in out of the cold or you'll be criminally we can't criminally prosecute but there is a U.S attorney who's on the team that when we find actionable intelligence and get it introduced into court in a civilian Rico he would then take it and see if he can pursue another criminal statute I got another question and the question is great people have come forward in the last few months you've had I don't even know how many people how many different whistleblowers have contacted you guys and and you know it if you're not looking at this with a skeptical buy for anybody you know that's listening you should be yeah how are you deciphering who the legitimate whistleblowers are from the Quacks first of all we ask for them to give evidence of they were who they were where they were we want to see a DD214 we want to see records and then we check them out and there's someone who's in our team who has um the ability to check them out through the system okay now even with that you know you could be tricked uh the best I can do now remember we're not the US government with trillions of dollars or depending on with 700 billion we're a volunteer organization Beth best we can do but the other thing is because I've debriefed legitimate people for 30 years on this literally over a thousand people not all of them are in the archive because some of them never wanted their names given to me but they were legit so what I say is that if if the story doesn't track and it it and the other is if what they're sharing comports with the evidence from another source but they don't know each other there's no collusion so then you say okay this gentleman in 1980 saw this this guy in 2009 saw this and it was essentially the same kind of operation craft what have you they don't know each other but they're and they're very reluctant they say you're not going to believe this is what they all say I said trust me I'll probably believe it but then when you get at points of corroboration so what I try to do is find multiple points of corroboration okay like we had like a dozen people who knew about the ET concerns about the nuclear issue so there's a whole area of multiple points of corroboration um and it's particularly useful when it's a similar event or company or facility a base where they were there at different times and don't know each other so there's then you don't have the someone being able to match up their stories in some tall tale so I have my own approach to this okay but obviously we don't have at this point now the difference is that if we when we launched this Rico civilian Rico action will have subpoena power and also Discovery so we can go to these spaces now we'll have to find a federal judge will certify it we'll see I'm glad we went through that because I mean it is you know it's it's tough to take somebody's word for things like this and so it's important you know I do the best I can now we almost were tricked by a guy back in 1997 who was coming to the briefings I set up for congress back then off-site at the Westin Hotel in Georgetown and Edgar Mitchell was there a bunch of fun people were there uh and it turned out he was telling a tall tale and my military advisor at that time was at a bar and he started talking about stuff that this guy knew absolutely was false so I had him escorted off the premises so you know you basically get one bite at the Apple with us at telling something that ends up to be nonsense um so that's that's kind of our policy but we you know because we don't have any kind of Signet our budget for all of this has been volunteers and a few donations and people who are devoted to it um so we can do only what we can do with the assets we have well you got a lot of assets I mean we talked about your crowdfunding capabilities earlier and those are quite impressive right so yeah we do the best we can you know uh but I always tell people I I'm confident of the ones that we're putting forward and of the ones we have in the archive uh which have not come for and and listen anyone listening you can come forward and only give information to me that you think is useful if you want to go to the Aero process and be protected under the new law and give your testimony we can do that if you want to come out publicly we can do that it's really up to the person to determine uh if they were in Special Forces or Lockheed scientists or whatever how they want to do it we just want as many people to come forward because there's there's strength in numbers but here's the other thing Sean we really need we need to continue to grow the current state-of-the-art knowledge of where facilities are operations code numbers code names all that because that's how the investigators and if necessary people who will bite force if necessary get these projects under control uh that's what they need to have well all the ways to contact you for the whistleblowers and anybody wanted to get involved volunteer are linked below great and and back to sorry I'm kind of all over this place here we're going down a lot of rabbit holes but when it comes to back to the Zero Point Energy and why the government will want to suppress them and we've talked about it and they're also in your documentaries as well that I mean you're taking I mean let's talk about how Exxon Mobil you know plays into this will all of the big Financial you know you know BlackRock Goldman Sachs JPMorgan Chase the Big Oil petrodollar all that is they understand that they want to keep the status quo uh or Tinker around the edges with what I call the pseudo-environmental initiatives like a Tesla car that you plug in well you have you know hundreds of pounds of Lithium-ion batteries that are toxic and how they're made and disposed of charging off a gas and coal-fired grid you know people don't think they think it's free energy no you're plugging into a grid that's smokestacks and maybe nuclear if you're lucky very little of it is wind and solar what 12 percent something uh so the problem is it has such a huge impact macro economically but I would correct one thing it's not the the US government doing anything like the U.S government I would say virtually no one in the Congress in the Pentagon or White House know about those Technologies so they're not suppressing them but are there people under cover of the authority of government doing it yes and that is the criminal aspect in the government that is the Rogue element in the government whether it's the patent office or the Department of Justice or anyone so they're deliberately I would say the majority of the US government where you're left right center would like to see a solution to the energy and environmental and poverty problems around the world um but of course there are a lot of pigs feeding at the trough for the lobbyist money from the impacted Industries because we're now we're talking hundreds of trillions of dollars in assets that are tied up in oil gas called nuclear Public Utilities I mean you'd look at the Fortune 500 list of companies globally uh not to mention nation states you know but you know I always point out we've had a 150 year run of that old smokestack technology these others should have begun to come out 100 years ago and transitioned over now we're hitting up a red line not only geophysically but geopolitically where you have half the world in poverty and let's face it if if everyone in the world where you've been and I've been live like you and I do the price of a gallon of of gasoline would be 150 a gallon if they were using the kind of energy that you and I use and it was all eight billion Souls on Earth so the only way to solve the human future issue and geopolitical problems is to allow these Technologies to begin to be phased in that at least you know create energy even if we hold back the things that fly I think these electrogravidics need to be held back I mean what I'm trying to do is is bring to the light how many corporations would be pissed off if we did hit Zero Point Energy you know the gas industry the power industry oh sure the car industry it's huge everything everyone well the car energy would just have to Pivot to the type of motor and an electric motor with a with a zero point generator and a little teeny three volt battery will start it up um you don't need these lithium-ion ginormous battery Banks those can be retrofitted but yes your your public utilities eventually will retire because every home business will have its own energy source um your big fossil fuel oil gas called nuclear power plants they'll all be mothballed now the only thing you'd really need oil for is uh you know chemicals petrochemicals Plastics things like that so that is something though it's not it's not going to happen instantaneously as I said earlier this is like a global Marshall plan to rebuild the planet and regain this 100 Years of lost Social Evolution for our civilization uh but we squandered a hundred years and I don't think we have a hundred years left to fix it I don't think we have 20. so I think that well within your lifetime and probably mine if I live old enough certainly my grandchildren uh we're going to need to have this established and done or we're going to be in in a true existential crisis so you have multiple crises coming in at once you know the secrecy around UFOs which is part and parcel keeping secret these Technologies right and who is that benefiting a handful of Elites super Elites now your average guy working at a utility plant or in an oil field those are going to need to be supported and retrained to these new high-tech Industries dealing with making this whole new system but I think you know we need to be very compassionate about the fact that there will be people displaced well at the same time though everything that we know will be a lot more affordable because it will not take the energy that it takes to produce all these things right now it'll be that energy will be free that's the biggest component you think about the energy it goes into digging into raw materials up manufacturing it shipping it to a place where it's assembled shipping it again and then delivering it to your store your home and the everything from the delivery bands and jets to the manufacturing process is running on the current Energy System so yes when the energy costs go to zero after you have a device that's operative then you're looking at the ability to have extraordinary abundance and this is that both this is a tie that'll lift all the boats in the third world developing World also by the way um and it's sort of like how they let frog from land lines like we used to have right to sell uh and and bite they just bypass the landlines the rest of the world will be able to go from having nothing in the way of energy generation three billion people have no power energy at all to having these systems and suddenly you're going to see so much happen in the world that is going to be a human advancement and aside from the air and everything becoming pristine and clean uh they're going to be such great opportunities for you know the dispossessed people of the world which I think if you don't pay attention to that this is how you end up in disgruntled segments of the population in the world that later become terrorists or adversaries so I think looking at this in a in the largest possible way you know it's it's a win-win for everyone if we take care of the workers that would be displaced as for the Mega giant corporate entities they just need to Pivot to these new technologies and realize that that error is over let's talk about some of the ways that they are suppressing these methods of free energy black shelving yep easy I know guys who've had this happen where they pick it up you know they'll get a buyout oh here's 50 million dollars you know there's a lieutenant colonel Bearden had a man who had one of these devices back years ago and the guy didn't have a pot to pee in and he was very you know a sort of this inventor bootstrapping it thing was real it was a real free energy device and next thing you know is he was he he's driving around in a Lamborghini and we're in Armani suits well you know he got basically they pay but he said yeah I can't talk about that it was bought it was put on the black shelf of a corporation there it sits so with enough money you can pretty much buy out what's your number in other words because if you're protecting a 900 trillion dollar asset base what is 50 million dollars nothing all right so and I know many people have had this happen so that black shelving goes on all the time uh uh the other of course and then you get into more of Nefarious activities National Security orders yeah nsos we have one in the film it shows the patent office slapping and National Security on a patent application of an inventor I know whose lab I have been in Pat and seizures Financial entanglements yep legal entanglements credible threats scientific fraud what is what do you mean by scientific fraud well this is where they will deliberately take a device and uh cause it to be uh altered so it doesn't work but they trick people to get money out of them so in other words I've actually been a victim of a couple of these very clever but it's basically where you try to siphon off the resources there's a big venture capital guy I know he was almost taken last year for 150 million dollars by a group that was going to put it into a fraudulent effort but so by intercepting that man's interest they would then of course side lightening so not his his financial interest we're not going to something productive that was deliberately being put into a fraudulent sting operation I've seen a number of these media Corporation well the media part of the problem is that even if you have one of these devices is the media going to report on it honestly well it's just like the UFO issue which is another reason why we need influencers like yourself but also some of these celebrities that have supported what we're doing because my view is that if we had one of these things right here on the table and it worked and we tested it reproduced it had plans for it the first 30 that we would make would go to some key people in DC and some big time celebrities that have their house running on it and you'd have two billion people find out about it in a matter of days because what you have to do is figure that the corrupt influences in the scientific and media community that have kept the UFO issue secret are going to kick in on this so you have to develop a strategy to work around that I liken that we need to be sort of water flowing and if there's a huge Boulder in front of us we flow around it or find a way around because there are going to be these obstacles and there have been and that's one of the big problems if the media had done its job on the all these issues notwithstanding their lip service to the environment and climate change if they had done their investigatory job as the fourth estate and a free press I wouldn't have had to leave my medical career so the biggest liability here is with the media Wet Works well that's just the term used the agency for assassinations and targeted killings um it's just a slang but wet comes from blood obviously but yeah a number of people I'm one in particular I worked with very closely uh was killed and I think others have been over the years um the you know because they they didn't do anything rational here's how they I'll be honest with you if you have this kind of information you're sort of holding a hand grenade in your hand that the Pen's been pulled if if it's up if it's not if it's a legitimate system because we're all these corrupt interests that'll do everything in their power to keep it from going from your lab out to the public so I think this is where you have to then have a strategic plan to disclose that open source and then get it out through alternative media and influencers and celebrities I mean everyone from Leo DiCaprio to Ariana Grande would be thrilled to have a device like this to save the environment right so you you use the strengths we have the strengths we have is that 99 of the population would benefit from this uh most of the people who are highly influential artists and celebrities would love to see it um and even the corrupt politicians once the public demand it they'll have to do it they'll have to say yeah thank you for your donation Exxon Mobil but we're still going to have to support this so a lot of this comes down to the public step we the people stepping in on this uh I think it's a huge mistake to think that the government of the United States or a big Corporation is going to do this you know the history shows they will not yeah that's for damn sure um there's I just we're running out of time here I know you got a flight to catch but um there's a couple of things that I wanted to ask you one of them being magic the organization that runs covert projects can you expound upon that a little bit well the majority joint intelligence committee it's a name that's been used uh back in the old days there was allegedly a group called Majestic 12. uh that was a group in the Truman era an early Eisenhower era but it's basically a committee it's transnational people from different countries that are on the upper end policy group of this oh problem and there are a number of people have been involved over the years certainly Admiral Bobby Ray Inman uh former Vice President Dick Cheney George H.W bush a number of people and I've met with some of the others uh and they're they pretty much determine policy uh on the these sort of big Global issues uh and part of part of their portfolio would be the UFO issue part of it would be all this new energy issue because they're panning glove the same thing yeah uh and then there are other uh problematic agendas how many people do you think are involved in this well I think at the upper level my understand is about two or three hundred uh folks globally yes oh yeah it's totally global you know I tell people it's not International the way we think of the state department and it's transnational so they basically maneuver and also in other countries this organization moves with alacrity across all boundaries with these sort of assets these sort of man-made UFOs and can do all kinds of operations with or but they don't need the permission of the host legal government so this has become a global power when Senator Anyway said there exists a secret government with its own Air Force its own Navy its own funding mechanism that's above the law and free from the law itself right his chairman of the Committees back then um and then he confirmed to my attorney when my attorney Derek Garcia was a young intern up on Capitol Hill that in fact he had seen the 2001 disclosure project event said yep Senator Henry said all that's true and there is a secret government running all this so I tell people I'll take my word for it listen to this high ranking senator there have been a number of people who tried to blow the whistle on this and point people the right way and no one followed up on it and I think it's now we're reaching a point now where I think we're out of time uh to let this stretch on for another even uh two or three years my understanding is that if within six to 12 months the results of this new bill is not forthcoming in other words if these corporations and individuals don't capitulate and provide what they have to the legal US government then force will be necessary which brings us to the Strike Team yeah yeah do you want to talk about the Strike Team I'll just say carefully that people who are utterly Fed Up in the legal government who have the means to do something Beyond a hearing that are you know special operators and what they're it absolutely a clock has been set let's talk about the reason for that is they now realize that the organizations doing this are treasonous and they are subverting the interests and the National Security of the United States and the Rogue elements the worst are doing all kinds of crimes Undercover a pentagon or undercover of agency under cover of the government excuse me this is a complete abuse of power so so is this Strike Team from the US government I don't want to comment beyond that it would be it'd be an authorized operation against these illegally run Rogue elements okay okay and obviously with full rights to do so so obviously uh and the really question becomes those guys anyone involved with that would need to have enough detailed information about what the adversary has right you're going to walk into an ambush otherwise so one of the things we have to do is get as much good detailed information on methods assets where they're located where the bases are where the entries are what technologies that can be deployed as a counter measure but we're all hoping this never has to happen because if the American people listening would actually take action and and the members of Congress and the White House would begin to take this very seriously all of that could be avoided and so my hope is that there's a smooth uh non-kinetic solution let's just put it that way completely unrelated to that yep the hoppy prophecy yeah yeah the hoopies well you know this is interesting because the time we live in many people feel many uh ancient peoples and even scriptures related to the time of the sort of the ending of one whole era in the opening of another and I think that's the truth I think we're at this point of transition between an old world and a new one now some people say it's the end of the world I said no it's the end of the old world in the opening of a new one so in the Hopi prophecy the the Hopi prophecy rock you know there's one line that terminates and that's our civilization terminating if we don't get this right there's another one where then it takes off and it goes off into Infinity so it's like Humanity as I see it is at this critical juncture where we need to choose whether we're going to go forward and keep going for hundreds of thousands of years and go out into space peacefully all of it or we're going to blow the whole system and not and and have a terminal situation so the hopies had this in their prophecy who are the hopies there's a Native American tribe in the desert Southwest okay my people my grandmother was Cherokee but you know I'm familiar with some of these different traditions and I think that my my dad was half Cherokee half Scottish interesting mix but uh but I think this is why you look at it many people around the world get this sense that we're at this inflection point not just politics and this and what have you but our whole civilization and I think these extraterrestrial civilizations know that they know that we we could get into a lot of bad trouble and have things happen that will be extinction level events if we're not careful on the other hand they know that if we came together and we're for once in our history did the right thing peacefully we could transition to a civilization that literally will be Interstellar uh maybe not my lifetime but in probably your children's wouldn't that be something yep yep oh yeah I have no doubt we certainly have the means to do it the technological yeah dude you think we're gonna get there oh I do I wouldn't be doing this if I were a pessimist I mean I think it's gonna be a bumpy ride I mean a smooth transition would have been before I was born when the et's Warren Truman and Eisenhower to make the transition but I think absolutely we can do it I've I had a beautiful lucid dream back when I was a young man and it was way in the future maybe I was around the age I am now and I was out at what looked like White Sands and it was and I met my wife in a lucid dream I have this sort of ability to dream in the future and then meet people like the aboriginals with dream time and all that it's also a Cherokee tradition but so I had this dream and it was this beautiful clear day the whole US military was supporting this peaceful contact event between humans and an extraterrestrial vehicle that was descending and there was a a very ancient E.T Elder that came out of it and it was televised globally and the whole world saw it and you know it was nothing scary about it it wasn't like some scary thing it was a very beautiful thing so I when I had that vision and dream I said well that's one possible future you know another other possible Futures and this gets into the homeless of spiritual question is the exercise of Free Will by humans individually and collectively now I chose to leave my medical career to do this a great difficulty but everyone can make their own decision here are you going to write to your member of Congress if you're someone involved these covert projects are you going to come forward or not these are all moral decisions as I see it spiritual and moral ethical um everybody you know everyone thinks morality is you know the peccadillos of men have an affairs I mean no no that's what you know in the Middle Ages was considered the foibles and silliness of humanity we're talking real moral choices here what are you going to do when you find out there's a issue like this and are you going to step up to the plate to fix it so it's a it's a moral question an ethical question for the Congress the president all of us and I think every citizen here and around the world because remember these same projects have assets parallel not as big in the United Kingdom Australia Brazil other countries no question I was going to ask that if there were Japan foreign you know oh yeah companies that are involved in this oh many and this whole committee that deals with it is like a little Uno on its own it's it's definitely International I know for a fact man this is global stuff yeah it's global and scary you know and well they are scary but they're not that many so here's the thing is what I tell people the vast majority of everyone on Earth the vast majority of everyone in legitimate governments of the Earth would be on the side of what we're advocating if they know the facts the evidence so that's what we have to put in front of them and hope people make the right choice that's all I can do I'm nobody I'm a private civilian retired from medicine but I do think that if the message resonates and enough people act it kind of creates this Collective conscious wave of change how would you like them to act I think that the leaders the the public needs to just get involved with this and write to their leaders and point them to the assets that we've handed off the disclosure project intelligence archive uh and ask for open hearings not I think the classified hearing process needs to end we need to go to open hearings and I know that's what a congressmember Chet and and uh Comer the chair of the government oversight committee and I understand the speaker of the house all think there should be open hearings on this the risk there is that they all get gas-lipped like I was talking about but this is where the public needs to weigh in and say don't be fooled by this other disinformation trajectory that's going to be put in front of you like last year the Pentagon released 1500 pages of material from Dr kit green and others that are involved in these clandestine operations with alien mutilations and abductions and people being burned and it every one of those cases in there I know for a fact we're done by humans masquerading as an alien encounter so the risk of of having people at the National Security Council and the Congress being deceived because they have no information is very great and this is where as Eisenhower said only an informed citizenry can avoid uh our loss of our democracy that he he said it I'm paraphrasing if you look look up that speech an informed citizenry so that's why guys like you are I think so key to this is helping to get the information out well thank you I am honored to be a part of it and um you know doctor once again I just really appreciate your time and coming here educating my audience and and myself because I am new to this this whole subject yeah and um and it's it's I just keep diving deeper hey it's a band of brothers and sisters trying to do something great for the country and the world and I I remember my my mother's ancestors were the first pows against the British in the American Revolution and they were this little ragtag they really were I mean George Wash all of them and look what they're going up against the British Empire but they won yeah so I always tell people you know you have to have the human spirit is capable of achieving great things when we come together and do it so that's what we need to do very true and um well I'd like to end this Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex and I'm going to play a speech at the end of this great he warned us about this a long time ago and here it is 1961. a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be Mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction our military organization today Bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea until the latest of our world conflicts the United States had no armaments industry American makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of National Defense we have been compelled to create a permanent arminence industry of vast proportions do this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment we annually spend on Military security alone more than the net income of all United States Corporation corporations now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American Experience the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every state house every Office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or Democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and Military Machinery of Defense with our peaceful methods and goals solar security and Liberty May Prosper together doctor best love to and I can't wait to see
