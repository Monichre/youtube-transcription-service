ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the UFO whistleblower Marathon this is part three of the three-part series remember all of these gentlemen have testified in front of Congress under oath today we have Eric Hecker who is a firefighter contractor for Raytheon which is a military-industrial complex company and he was in Antarctica to Raytheon facility and says that Raytheon has the technology to produce earthquakes all throughout the planet if you like what you see please like subscribe and comment go to Spotify go to Apple podcast leave us a review and you content creators out there we've seen you all taken our content making your own stuff putting it out on the internet most people probably don't like that we love it so we made it easy for you go down there's a link in the description has lots hundreds of free downloadable raw reels that you can download for free make them into whatever you want monetize it make money off of it put it on Tick Tock put it on all the social media channels we appreciate it all we ask so you tag the show I love you all enjoy the last part of this series it was a really good one and we'll see you soon Eric Hecker Sean welcome to the show brother thank you very much for having me sir my pleasure so you are the only testimony that I did not get to hear at the conference I had a flight and uh the conference went way over time and so this is totally fresh to me right now and uh definitely fresh to the audience but just a little intro on you so you were a contractor for Raytheon which Raytheon how would you describe Raytheon uh I would say that Raytheon is a military industrial contractor that normally is making weapons and targeting systems for the military and oddly enough had a contract to provide Jano services at the South Pole station interesting from 2010 to 2011 you were a Tradesman and firefighter in the South Pole Antarctica is a contractor for Raytheon you spent 366 continuous days at the South Bowl you were experimented on as a child and trying to be a remote viewer correct through a program called Stargate project a submarine service in the Navy plumber for the wealthy Elite on law on an island prior to Raytheon and experience with UFOs yes um you're a whistleblower for the benefit of humanity why are you blowing the whistle now because I'm obliged to I don't know anybody that's walked a similar path to me in life so it's necessary information that gets out there I wish that I could be relieved of the task but until I can find someone that can properly handle this information I have to be on point for it Roger that well just like everybody else we always start off with a gift thank you sir if you don't guess this huh God would sit in there pull them out you got it we have genuine vigilance Elite gummies nice illegal in all 50 states they are they're illegal in all 50 states believe it or not thank you very much you're welcome I think they're still legal in all 50 states I don't know you know laws change very fast nowadays tyranny might uh start coming after candy next who knows but today uh we're here to talk about Raytheon Technologies Corporation Raytheon is an aerospace company that provides Advanced systems and services for commercial military and government customers worldwide probe for corruption and Government Contracting since 1980s you were in the South Pole from 2010 to 2011. let's talk about what you were doing down there you got it what were you doing down there I was contracted for the summer season as a plumber I did well enough in my summer season to Garner a winter contract as well which got me my full Year's stay I was also tasked with being a firefighter I was a lead on the firefighting team and because of that dual role capacity I physically held a key that opened every single door in the facility I had complete access to every compartment they manufactured that was a rare position to be in Waters what are you blowing the whistle on that there are Technologies at the South Pole station that people can't even consider that exist on this planet like what directed energy weapon systems is something that people need to get in their vocabulary fast the Ice Cube neutrino detector is not simply a passive listening device as presented for the science that they're claiming it to do it also has the capacity to transmit there are embedded in the ice what are called digital optical modules Doms they're about the size of a basketball the array embedded in the ice is one kilometer by one kilometer by one kilometer it is the world's largest telescope and now because we have proven that it can transmit it's the world's largest directed energy weapon system it is responsible for the earthquakes in Christchurch New Zealand in 2011 on the front end of the year how do you know for a fact that that was responsible for that because I was present and I have gone over this with the pertinent people that I will not be releasing their names okay but I was on the team let's just say and I've confirmed this well I've provided documentation from the actual manufacturer specs so this unit was constructed operated and maintained by the University of Wisconsin and just like every other device on the planet whether you're driving an M1 Abrams tank or operating the Ice Cube neutrino detector there's um operator's manuals that tell you how things work right there in that information free for everybody to find I found it myself I was directed to find it I'll put it that way and release this information and it states very clearly that each one of these Doms can transmit at 2047 volts each so these are currently The Facts of Life how do you know I mean how do you what I guess what I'm asking is how did it even come to your attention that this triggered an earthquake if you're at the South Pole and New Zealand had an earthquake I mean how did you know it came from the South Pole without divulging names without divulging names I can only say that it was communicated to me from team members that were present and fully read in at the time that they were aware and since that time at the immediate medical like the same day oh absolutely it was understood well what was said that we accidentally hit Christchurch New Zealand twice when they were trying to fire up this weapon for the first time that it was It was friendly fire it was not on purpose but it occurred that the system is designed for that and it was just friendly fire so this is a so this is a telescope that sounds like a is it a telescope absolutely it is it is a neutrino detector for sure it can accomplish its primary purpose it can also transmit and then provide a multi-faceted platform for directed energy weapons systems do you have any idea how the earthquake was initiated from misfiring the system where did I mean where were they targeting yes I don't know does it go into the Earth does it go into the atmosphere it can definitely go through the earth I would consider that it might be able to do stuff in the atmosphere I haven't heard that statement laid at its feet but I wouldn't put it past it I don't want to try to limit the functions of this device by my imagination or experience I believe that's one of the problems with directed energy weapons is they are not like standard weapons of old where you have a gun and a particular caliber bullet you pull the trigger and it does one thing these platforms are way more complex than that they do a lot of things what else do they do excuse me this system additionally in regards to the neutrinos it detects the neutrinos that are apparently coming off of the new exotic propulsion systems for either off-world UFOs or reverse engineered stuff on our planet what is neutrino neutrino is a near massless particle that goes at close or beyond the speed of light it is so small that it can pass between the electron shell and the nucleus of pretty much every atom on the planet and the capacity of being detected at the South Pole station when the neutrino impacts the nucleus of the water molecule of the ice in the glaciers at the polar reaction occurs the nucleus and the neutrino become destroyed a muon is created and ejected in a blue flash of light known as charinkoff radiation flashes in the ice and that's what the Doms the digital optical modules are detecting that's their primary purpose as presented now whether that neutrino comes from a quasar out in space or a exotic propelled engine off of vehicles that aren't being discussed contemporarily it detects it thus making it basically an air traffic control center for all non-discussed vehicles on this planet so just like we have all the other air traffic on the planet and it's being completely observed and attended to there's just another level of Craft on this planet and another level of air traffic control tower that exists this is that facility back to back to tracking neutrinos what is what is that why are they tracking those oh for the purposes of science they're claiming that there's a lot to be ascertained by understanding the difference between low power and high power neutrino ejections from cosmic occurrences it's about that vague this is what they spend our tax dollars on let's talk about the well what else do they do uh the device is also um for faster than like Communications Quantum entangled Communications at Great distance and I guess it was the late 80s or early 90s Gary McKinnon hacked NASA and he found that we he found the list of the off-world space Fleet and the captains of the ships respectively we have a fleet out there if we have a fleet out there we need to communicate with them this is that facility can you explain quantum entanglement Communications yes I don't think most people understand what I'm about to say anyway but I will the way quantum entanglement works is that you can take uh you can take two particles Quantum entangle them and then take those two particles and move them at any distance in the cosmos and let's just say for example if you Quantum entangle two electrons and you have them spinning in the same direction and then you take one of those electrons and you shoot that thing out a hundred thousand light years from the original if you then rotate the spin on the one electron if you if you modify it so that its spin changes the quantum entangled electron at any distance will simultaneously in no time switch its rotation also because they're Quantum entangled so these communication systems are taking advantage of this aspect of quantum mechanics that most people can't wrap their heads around and this is what they're utilizing it's just the new level of science that affords us the ability to communicate at any distance instantaneously I've heard about this I've tried to dig into it and it's hard to understand it is hard to understand um it would be my my best way to put it is that when electricity first came out it was very hard for a lot of people to understand what Nikola Tesla was getting at but we can we still everyone was using it before they even understood it and this is just where we are right now it's just a new technology it's a new conversation people don't have to understand it yet they just have to realize it's real what other kind of things can this oh boy um voice to skull technology this is also in the foray of directed energy weapons what is that uh the ability to let's just say throw your voice into your head or my voice into my head or allowing algorithms that now they can blanket a whole geographical area and they can make everybody change their thoughts they can I use the term intrusive thoughts um back to that fork in the road analogy if you find yourself where you have to make a decision about something next thing you know you catch yourself kind of having an argument in your head with your own voices well the ability to add another one of your voices in there but have it controlled by somebody else's microphone so to say is a very powerful tool and I think this is a weapon of war that we are seeing happen to everyone around us the Department of Defense recently started initiating protocols for their employees their agents to discuss Havana syndrome Havana syndrome-like symptoms and on that list is that their agents are hearing voices in their head and this is what they're getting at this is that technology that you know next thing you know you're trying to make a decision but there's another Sean in your head that now is actually somebody else's control and through the manipulation of that voice they can now push you just like we have you know the cell phones are weaponized now the social media platforms and they can engage with an algorithm and they know that they can push you in a direction by repetitive information being displayed in front of you similar to the tequistoscope and grammar school that they can learn your system and they can learn to manipulate it on a personalized level by just assessing you what the things are that you're interested in what are your weak points what's the crack in the damn what's the angle of attack and it's through repetition and access these are simply electromagnetic impulses in your head it's not that they can't be read it's not that it can't be copied and it's not that they can't be just replayed with somebody else's control I mean I could get a voice changing thing and I can sound like you if I wanted to I could call you on the phone I could call your loved ones and I could pretend I'm Sean they can do that for you in your own head if you're a business owner and you're hiring right now you are also dealing with economic uncertainty now is the time more than any

with looking at the causation of this crisis at our Southern border you know it wasn't more than a couple years ago during the Democratic primary your boss now President Biden said during a debate We're a nation that says you want to flee your fleeing oppression you should come [Music] thank you what's with the open borders what are they open to accomplish well I think I don't think it's you know one simple answer like a lot of things I think it's complicated like human beings are complicated but I think there's a couple different buckets there in my opinion I think there are globalists around the world and within our own country that don't want to see you know they don't want to see borders anymore this is an historic moment we have in this past year made great progress ending the long era of conflict and Cold War we have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future Generations a new world order a world where the rule of law not the law of the Jungle governs the conduct of Nations [Music] how are you finding all of this out years of research the McDonald's corporation just had a an ad come out a few months ago that they're looking into research and development in a technology that will afford them the ability to pump their commercials into your brain while you're sleeping do you think that they figured this out or some other company figured it out first you think if they're going to have this available to them next year you think that there weren't agencies that have been wielding this for a decade or so you're 100 is there any work in I read about this it's immediately available on the internet that McDonald's put this out there McDonald's McDonald's corporation is looking into putting commercials into our brains while we're sleeping and that's we can look that up absolutely understood but now imagine when if they can do that next year um who's who's been doing it for the last decade or so I'm with you all right 100 with you so now when we look around the world and we see everybody acting the way that they are acting let's consider that these intrusive thoughts have already been present what do we do about this this is the these These are the weapons of working temporarily it's very unfortunate but it used to be that war was a bit more noble when we selected people we put them in uniforms we sent them over there to the battlefield and we said fight for us and effectively that would have been an act of attrition of each nation's resources until there was a Victor now unfortunately they've circumnavigated the battlefield nobody's dressed in uniforms anymore and the front line is every neighborhood that we're in and the infrastructure is still under attack it's just that now the average mortgage payer is in the line of fire the list of Havana syndrome-like symptoms which my South Pole crew and many South Pole crews are suffering that other agencies are suffering if people pay really close attention they're going to notice that these symptoms are prevalent in the general population as well interesting I interviewed a former CIA agent about this who has Havana syndrome and has been speaking out on it um quite a bit his name's mark polypernopoulos but um what I mean is there anything else going on down there I think we just went through a lot of stuff here yes actually uh there's a system known as elf extra low frequency uh it's also a massive antenna that's embedded in the ice there when I arrived to the facility as a Tradesman and firefighter I was read into how everything worked because I needed for the safety of my crew to be able to battle fires and and engage things appropriately and at the onset I was told that the elf system is off it's defunct it's disabled it is just sitting dead in the ice but through my uh need to make an additional repair on something else and tracing back to a sub panel I was finding the circuit that I needed to lock out tag out and do all the safe repairs but then I noticed that this other breaker That was supposed to be off was in the on position and it was listed as the elf and I ran it up my chain I said what's going on here I said this is supposed to be off I was told it's off now and I was just given a hard it's on that was the end of my need to know they didn't want to tell me anything else you you have identified the circuit that you need to work on you have been informed that you can safely do your job carry on so I did my job I made the repair that I needed to on the circuit next to the Circuit that I was now informed as duly on and operating so the elf is up and running and that again is a multi-faceted directed energy weapons platform do you have pictures of any of this stuff I have a lot of pictures of me in these facilities um they mostly just prove my presence can if you hand those over I'll display them on screen right now if I can get them I can get you pictures before you present this to the world I would appreciate that let's talk about the clear air system called Arrow yes commonly referred to as the no-fly zone yes the arrow building Aro is the atmospheric research Observatory it is listed on the chart the one that I gave you as well as a no-fly zone in the Vegas sense of the term at first glance but as any pilot knows there's always you know fine print so the no-fly zone as listed at the South Pole station because of Arrow simply provides a limit to the ability for a plane to fly too low it sets the floor at 8 000 feet you can't fly below 8 000 feet a lot of people like to try to claim that there's a hole at South Pole station and there's a no-fly zone that protects from you flying in an area that'll see the hole and that's just total Shenanigans the no-fly zone limits your ability to fly low not high so with that height available you will see everything available to see which is ice as far as the eye can see there is no hole in the ice at the South Pole station there may be one somewhere else I can't testify to the entirety of the continent it's huge well as I can say is that when people are talking about there being a hole at the South Pole they're full of crap they don't know what they're talking about they're taking something that they know very little about and just running with it they say in other ways that you know a little information is a dangerous thing and that's what these people are doing is they're operating off of very little information the atmospheric research Observatory as I testified in DC I witnessed myself in doing my standard rounds in the winter season at South Pole station that that building would with great regularity have a very powerful green laser beam shooting out of it into the cosmos I believe through other things that I've located there which is the um the chilled helium in a massive amount it is chilled down to four degrees Kelvin in storage which my understanding this is something new that I'm learning about it's called super fluids super fluids act very differently than other things in our scientific spectrum and are used for things called chemical lasers well we had a superfluid and we had a laser so I believe that what I'm learning on this is that it was probably a secondary means of long-range communication and or another weapons platform June 18th was my birthday right after Dr Greer's event of June 12th on June 18th the National Science Foundation website could have posted anything they wanted for a photograph but on my birthday I would say I got a gift from someone in the program because they posted a picture of the arrow building's green laser blasting into the cosmos which verifies exactly what I saw interesting and you think that might be a communication device oh they'd be communicating with the laser I I don't understand the science of it I just know that it exists okay laser laser beam communication direct line of sight laser beam comms microwave type comms it exists you say a lot of the crew members from the South Pole are experiencing Havana syndrome symptoms what are some of those symptoms uh they have mental degradation troubles with their memory fatigue stuff like that skin issues headaches yes the Antarctica Treaty of 1950 59. an agreement signed by 12 nations in which Antarctica the Antarctic continent was made demilitarized to be preserved for scientific research what do you think about that I think it's a load of Milwaukee and I'm going to throw a gentleman's name out there that I have worked with he told me very specifically at the time that we communicated he's going to die when he sees this video I worked with a gentleman by the name of Aaron Bontrager and he was also previously contracted by Raytheon polish Services as a cook to work on a cat train that went across the ice and he said the express purpose for him I should say for that team working for Raytheon was they were searching for missile site locations kidding correct the whole idea of this being demilitarized is a load of baloney how do you think they're getting how are they powering this facility I believe there's a secondary power source inside of the old pole that was built in 1957 the original poll I should say built in 1957 we referred to as old Pole um there was other facilities that were manufactured different stages of inhabitation of crew so 1957 was the first one it predates the Antarctic treaty which means that they could have had nuclear power there I believe they did have nuclear power there and that since then they may have maintained it almost like a grandfather clause or that they may have new more exotic systems that are not in the legalese of the treaty why do you think Antarctica is a no-fly zone Antarctica is not a no-fly zone well uh uh Arrow commonly referred to as a no-fly zone why it's it's a misnomer you can fly right over the no-fly zone you just have to be higher than 8 000 feet well I'm asking why do you have to be higher than eight thousand oh because it's because of the uh they're doing science on the uh the cleanliness of the air so they just don't want it tainted similarly there's no land traffic allowed in that area so you can take a snow machine if I wanted to go visit the building to do my rounds I could take a snow machine up to a certain point and then I had to stop the snow machine and walk because simply the exhaust gases from the machine would taint their sensors so I also the only reason they're trying to block out vehicular activity is to keep the exhaust gases out of their Sensors how do you get there how do you get to Arrow yeah it's within walking distance of the elevated station how do you how do you fly into Antarctica uh you fly in with a herc lc-130 how are hercon skis and you just come in from outside of that quadrant or or above 8 000 feet okay how much air traffic is going around there uh during the summer seasons 24 hours of operation they typically have a huge a few hercs on Deck idling um most of the time and a lot of uh a lot of fuel is brought in by herc uh our waste is brought out by herc when the Airmen will allow themselves to be a flying garbage can as they claim but um yeah basically almost almost all operations and Logistics were done by herc while we were there in my 2010 season they had brought in their first fuel Hall over land as kind of an experiment to the process and it's my understanding that they call this a Traverse that they have since increased Traverse activity to drag large fuel bladders across the ice to resupply the fuel that way being more economic than doing it by herc and then affording that volume of hurt space it's not being utilized for fuel now can of course do other things the the flight operations are almost 24 hours a day during the summer season because nothing moves in the winter season so everything has to occur in a certain window okay man back to the putting voices in people's heads um are you aware of any ways to defend against that know thyself it's an ancient practice and it's an ancient practice for a reason these modern Technologies are bastardizations of ancient techniques way back in the day they would call someone a magician who has Adept at this skill I could walk into the room and I would potentially have that skill set to put my thought in your head it's just a technique it's completely doable but now we have people that are no longer going through these schools of nobility to learn to practice these things nicely and we have evil people that are taking Technologies and utilizing them because again it's just simply electromagnetic impulses that can be read they can be used they can be hijacked Eric is there anything that I'm missing that you want to bring to the public hmm that's a great question I want to emphasize that we are currently in a state of war that people aren't realizing what is that these weapons are being wielded around us against us there are power players that are above nation states geographical boundaries and political parties mean very little to the wealthy Elite on this planet where we're pawns we're chattel um I am a person for the people we the people of this planet deserve a better future than the one we are being presented we've we've all through our Blood Sweat and Tears we've invested here in the United States we've invested our taxpayer dollars for these people to create weapon systems that they're using against us this is It's a Sin it's illegal it's a sin it's immoral and we have to do better for the future generations of this planet or your word for your safety no why not I'm I'm just simply beyond that I don't um I don't really care what happens to me I care about doing the right thing do you think you're in danger I guess theoretically people don't like me doing what I'm doing I would say probably not fair enough but um work if that's it that's a lot of info in a short amount of time and I really appreciate you coming here and um and inform us all so have you been approached by any BD Outlets I've been approached by a lot of people really and I pretty much tell them to go scratch why do you tell them that because I can tell from the way that they approach me they're not looking to do Justice by what I'm saying they're what I refer to as dissipators people that are looking to waste my energy diverted into the wrong direction I'm very fortunate I would say blessed to have met someone like yourself who seems to be on the up and up and going um to fight the good fight on this stuff to get to the actual brass tax truth and present it to the world in an untainted capacity there's there's a lot of bad things going on on this planet I'm sure that you've experienced it yourself firsthand and you're aware that a lot of people don't know that these things are happening in the shadows I want people to know what's really going on on this planet so they can make educated decisions about what they have to do to protect themselves and their children well that's very normal of you man I really appreciate it I I have uh I have I don't that's a lot of in photo process I'm just gonna take me a minute to come up with questions and would you be willing to come back I would love to come back let me digest this and then [Music] time be safe thank you for coming out here and
